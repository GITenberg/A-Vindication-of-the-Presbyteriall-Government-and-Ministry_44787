<p>Transcriber's Note:</p>

<p>The text includes a large number of marginal notes that are printed in
small font and are sometimes unclear. They have been converted into
footnotes or (if they comprise general descriptions of a passage) into
sidenotes. A footnote may refer to the following, rather than
preceding, word or phrase. If so the footnote anchor has been
positioned accordingly.</p>

<p>Many of the paragraphs are numbered according to a complex scheme.
Only on one page are they indented. The size of the font used varies,
often within a paragraph. While the numbering has been retained the
indenting has been removed and variations in font size ignored.</p>

<p>Apparent typographical errors, and inconsistencies in hyphenation,
have been corrected. Greek accents are often unclear and (apart from
rough-breathing marks) have been omitted.</p>

<p>The error noted at the end of the text has been incorporated.</p>

<p class="dropcap-ill-i"><i>IT hath been the chief stratagem of the adversaries of the Church,
in all Ages, to erect a</i> throne <i>for themselves, in the hearts of
people, by casting reproaches and slanders upon the</i> Doctrine,
Government, <i>and</i> Godly Ministers <i>of</i> Jesus Christ. <i>In
the old Testament, when the Jewes came first out of</i> Babylon,
<i>and began to build the second Temple of</i> Jerusalem, <i>their
enemies most falsly, and maliciously, suggested to King</i>
Artaxerxes, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_1" id="Ref_1" href="#Foot_1">[1]</a></span>That
the City of Jerusalem, was a rebellious City, and
hurtful unto Kings and Provinces, and that they had moved sedition
within the same, of old time, <i>&amp;c.</i> <i>And thereby caused the work of
the house of God, to cease for many years. And in the New Testament,
when the Holy Ghost came down from Heaven in a most miraculous manner,
for the</i> solemn inauguration of Christian Religion; <i>and when the
Apostles were filled with the</i> Holy Spirit, <i>even then, they
were charged to be</i> full of new wine. <i>And in after-times, the
slanderous accusations of the</i> Heathen <i>Idolaters against the</i>
Christians, <i>are observed to have been one of the chiefest causes of
the</i> ten bloudy Persecutions, <i>raised up against them by the</i>
Romane Emperours. <i>And this was that which forced the Godly-learned
of those days, to write</i> Apologies, <i>in defence of</i>
Christians, and Christian Religion.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_2" id="Ref_2" href="#Foot_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p><i>To come neerer to our own times; when the Protestant Religion began
to be re-established (after the bloudy times of Queen</i>
Mary) <i>it was loaded with so many infamous lyes, and malicious
falsities, That</i> Reverend and learned Jewell, <i>was compelled to
write an</i> Apologie<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_3" id="Ref_3" href="#Foot_3">[3]</a></span>
<i>for it; for which, he will be famous in the
Churches, to all Posterity. And even in our dayes, when it pleased
God, out of his infinite goodness, to lay a</i> foundation <i>of a
glorious</i> Reformation in Church-Discipline, <i>in this Kingdom,
and to raise up the hearts of many</i> Godly Ministers, <i>and others,
to contribute their utmost help for the perfecting of it, Then did a
Generation of men rise up, who made it their great design to
pour out flouds of reproaches, and calumnies, upon both Government,
and Ministers. First, they represent the Government unto
the people, as</i> absolutely destructive <i>unto the</i> civill State, <i>to the</i>
liberties <i>both of their soules and bodies, and as unsufferable in a</i>
free Kingdom. <i>And then the</i> Ministers <i>that assert it, as men
that seek to ingross</i> all power <i>into their own hands, as the chief</i>
Incendiaries <i>of Church and State, and as the causes of all the
miseries, that have of late years come upon the three Kingdoms.</i></p>

<p><i>And therefore, We,</i> Ministers and Elders <i>met together, by the
Authority of Parliament, in the Provincial Assembly of the Province
of</i> London, <i>considering with our selves, what way we might be
serviceable in this great work of</i> Reformation, <i>have thought it
our duties to wipe off those</i> foul aspersions, <i>that are cast
upon it, and upon those who have been active for it; and to dispel the
mists and fogs, which have so long darkened the glorious Sun-shine of
this blessed Reformation.</i></p>

<p><i>And because we also find, that there are many, who doubt, whether
there be any particular</i> Church-government <i>prescribed in the
Word; and if so, whether it be the</i> Presbyterial, <i>or</i>
Congregationall. <i>And others that question the lawfulness of</i>
Ruling-Elders, <i>and of their joynt power, with the</i> Minister,
<i>to examine those that are admitted to the Sacrament of the Lords
Supper; Therefore, we have also thought it most necessary for us to
search into the Word, and to deliver our judgments in all these
particulars.</i></p>

<p><i>And further, because we observe with grief of heart, that sin and
iniquity abounds, and many separate from our Congregations, and run
head-long into heretical, and soul-damning opinions; And those that do
joyn with us in the</i> Presbyteriall
Government, <i>both Ministers, Elders, and People, meet with
many discouragements, and may (possibly) grow faint, and
weary and neglective of their duties: Therefore, We have also
thought our selves obliged, to our</i> Vindication, <i>to adde an</i> Exhortation,
<i>unto all Ministers, Elders, and People, within the
bounds of our Province, whether joyning with us, or separating
from us</i>.</p>

<p><i>The work (we acknowledge) is very weighty, and difficult; and the
times wherein we live, are very perillous, in which men are made</i>
Offenders for a word; <i>Provincial Assemblies (as now constituted)
are new, and strange with us, weak in power, and of no repute with
many; suspected by some, as likely to prove prejudiciall to the
Kingdom; and by others, to the liberty of Congregations. And the
judgments and consciences of most people, are so prepossessed with
prejudices and self-interest, as that we cannot but expect, that
this</i> our first expression of our selves, <i>will meet with much
opposition, and contradiction. Some will not vouchsafe to read it;
Others will read it, and contemn it; Others will mock and scoff at it.
But our comfort is, the Testimony of our Consciences. That the grounds
of this our present undertaking, are neither</i> pragmaticalness of
spirit, <i>nor to</i> vent <i>our own</i> spleen, <i>in aspersing
others; nor</i> affectation of domination <i>over others; nor to blow
the Trumpet to new troubles. But our ends and ayms, herein, sincerely
are</i>, That the truths of Christ may be vindicated, the Government
of the Lord Jesus advanced, the power of Godliness exalted, the credit
of the Godly Ministry repaired, the unity of the Spirit gained, and
kept in the bond of peace, That our Congregations may be purged,
purity of Ordinances promoted, divisions healed, breaches made up,
stumbling blocks removed; That those who stand may be established, the
weak &amp; feeble strengthened, the seduced may be converted from the
errour of their wayes and repent, to the acknowledgment of the truth;
That languishing gifts and graces, may be quickened and increased;
That a through Reformation (according to our solemn Covenant) may be
really endeavoured; That no means of edification, may by Us be
neglected; That we may keep our
selves pure from the bloud of all men: That the Kingdome
of our Lord and Saviour may be inlarged, and God in all
things glorified.</p>

<p><i>We confess, it is hardly possible, to wipe off the dirt cast upon
us, but some of it will necessarily light upon those that cast it;
(and it is fit, that they, that unjustly besmear others, should have
their own filthiness impartially discovered) yet notwithstanding,
we have purposely avoided, as much as may be, all personall reflections,
and have waved the answering of some objections
made against us, lest in answering to them, we should give
occasion, to those that seek occasion. And we doubt not (however
others may be transported with passion, or prejudice) but
this endeavour of ours, which so much concerns the preservation
of Religion, Truth, Godliness, and Ministry from ruine and
destruction, will be acceptable, to all sober, and unbyassed Christians.</i></p>

<p><i>We shall begin with our</i> Vindication, <i>and therein first assert
Church-Government, by Divine Right; and then clear up the</i>
Presbyteriall Government, <i>and</i> Ministry; <i>and represent them
unto you, in their native colours; and afterwards proceed to our</i>
Exhortation.</p>

<h2>The VINDICATION.</h2>
<hr />

<div>
<img class="dropcap-ill" src="images/drop-t.png" alt="drop-t"/>
</div>

<p class="dropcap-ill-t">THE externall Government and Discipline of <i>Christ</i>, (though it
be not necessary to the being, yet it) is absolutely necessary to the
well-being of a Church: So necessary, as that we cannot but be deeply
affected with grief and sorrow, when we consider how long the through
setling of it hath been delayed, (notwithstanding the Covenant we have
taken, with hands lifted up to heaven, to endeavor a reformation in
point of Discipline) and cannot but conceive it to be one chief reason
of all the miseries that are now upon us; because those that have been
in Authority amongst us, have laboured to build their own houses, and
have suffered the house of God to lye waste. If <i>Nehemiah</i> sate
down and wept, and mourned certain days, because the <i>wall of
Jerusalem was broken down</i>, &amp;c. Much more have we cause to mourn,
that the <i>wall of Zion is not yet reared up</i>; for as a <i>City
without walls</i>, <i>a Sea without banks</i>, <i>a vineyard without a
hedge</i>, so is a Church without Discipline, and he that shall
consider the multitude of Heresies and Blasphemies, the abundance of
iniquities and abominations, that have crowded into the Church,
whilest this wall hath been unbuilt, and this hedge unmade; cannot but
take up the lamentation of <i>David</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_4" id="Ref_4" href="#Foot_4">[4]</a></span>,
though with a little
difference,----<i>Why hast thou suffered thy Vineyard to be without a
hedge, so that all they which do passe by pluck her. The Boar out of
the wood doth waste it, and the wild Beasts of the field devour it.
Return, we beseech</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">{2}</a></span>
<i>thee, O Lord of Hosts; look down from Heaven, and behold
and visit this Vine, and the Vineyard which thy right hand hath
planted, and the branch that thou madest strong for thy self</i>, &amp;c.
And likewise to pray the prayer of the same Prophet in
another place<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_5" id="Ref_5" href="#Foot_5">[5]</a></span>,
<i>Do good in thy good pleasure to Zion, and
build thou the walls of Jerusalem</i>.</p>

<p>The differences, we confess, about this wall, are very many, and so
many, as that it would require a large Volume to treat of them; and it
cannot be denyed, but these differences have been the great apple of
strife for these many years: And although it be our design (as we have
said) to heal and make up the breaches of this wofully divided Church,
and not to widen and increase them; yet notwithstanding, we cannot
without prejudice to the truth, to our selves, and to our respective
Congregations, but give the world some short account of <i>two
opinions</i> about Church-Government.</p>

<p>There are some, that although they have taken a <i>Covenant</i>, to
endeavour the Reformation of the <i>Church</i> in Discipline,
according to the <i>Word</i>, yet are not afraid to say; That there is
<i>no particular Church-Government</i> set down in the <i>Word</i>;
that the <i>Christian Magistrate</i> is the <i>Fountain</i> of all
<i>Church-power</i>, and that to assert a <i>jus divinum</i> of
<i>Church-Government</i>, is <i>destructive</i> to all political
Government. Now though this Opinion prevail much with<i>State-Divines</i>,
and with Christians that study <i>worldly-policy</i>, more then
<i>Scripture simplicity</i>; And though it be likely (if God prevent
not) to swallow up in a short time, all other Opinions about <i>Church
Government</i>: And though the asserting of a <i>jus divinum</i> in
<i>Church-Discipline</i>, be with some men, <i>the only heresie not to
be tolerated</i>, and more hated, then the <i>abomination of
desolation</i>, standing in the holy place, was by the Jews; yet
notwithstanding, we hold it our duties, especially in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">{3}</a></span>
these times, to make it known to all our respective Congregations.</p>

<p>1. <i>That Jesus Christ, as King and Head of his Church, hath
appointed a particular Government in his Church.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>That the Christian Magistrate, is not the originall of Church
Government.</i> Which two particulars, we shall endeavour with great
brevity and perspicuity, to make out unto all unprejudiced Christians.
And first.</p>

<p>1. <i>That there is a particular Church-Government by divine
right</i>: not that we think, that every <i>circumstance</i> in
<i>Church Government</i> is set down precisely in the <i>Word</i>, or
is of <i>divine right</i> in a strict sence: But this we say, That the
<i>substantials and essentials</i>, are recorded particularly in the
Word by Christ, the King of his Church, and are unalterable by any
State whatsoever; And that the <i>circumstantials</i> are set down
under generall rules, sufficient for the ordering of them; and that
therefore, even they also in a large sence may be said to be of a
<i>divine right</i>. Now this we shall endeavour to prove by these
ensuing Arguments.</p>

<p>1. <i>From the fulness, and sufficiency of the Holy Scriptures.</i>
The <i>Apostle Paul</i> saith, that his first Epistle to
<i>Timothy</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_6" id="Ref_6" href="#Foot_6">[6]</a></span>,
was written, <i>To teach him how to behave himself in
the house of God, which is the Church of the living God, the pillar
and ground of truth</i>. And in his second Epistle<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_7" id="Ref_7" href="#Foot_7">[7]</a></span>
he tels us; <i>That
the holy Scriptures are able to make the man of God perfect, throughly
furnished unto all good works</i>. Now to know how to govern the
Church, is one of the great works that belong to the Minister: And
therefore, to say, that this is not recorded in Scripture, is to make
the holy Scripture a rule <i>defective, and ineffectuall for the end
for which it was written</i>, and to cast a very great <i>reproach and
dishonour upon it</i>. And surely, if some substantiall parts of
Church-Government, are exprest in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">{4}</a></span>
Word (as few will deny) then (as we conceive) all of
them of necessity must be expressed, or else the Word
should not be able to attain its end; which to affirm, is
no small errour: And for our parts, we cannot conceive
any reason to induce us to believe, that the <i>Holy Ghost</i>
should set down in the Word, some of the <i>substantials
of Church-Goverment</i>, as binding and unalterable unto
the end of the World, and leave other things as <i>substantiall</i>
as they, <i>arbitrary and alterable</i>, according to the will
and pleasure of the <i>Christian Magistrate</i>.</p>

<p>2. <i>From the excellency of the Kingly Office of Jesus Christ</i>;
For <i>Christ Jesus</i> is the only <i>King</i> of his Church, governing
it not only inwardly, and invisibly, by the working of his Spirit; but
outwardly also, and visibly, as it is a visible, politicall, and
ministeriall body, in which he hath appointed his own proper

class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_11" id="Ref_11" href="#Foot_11">[11]</a></span><i>Ordinances</i>,
and <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_12" id="Ref_12" href="#Foot_12">[12]</a></span><i>Censures</i>,
to be administred in his name, and according
to his own way. As a King of this politicall and ministeriall Church,
he <i>breathed on his Disciples, and said, Receive the Holy Ghost,
whose sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose sins ye
retain, they are retained</i>. As a King of this visible Church, he
said unto his Apostles, <i>All power is given to me in Heaven, and in
Earth; Go ye therefore, and teach all Nations, baptising them in the
name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, teaching
them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you; and lo I
am with you alway, even unto the end of the world</i>. As a King of
the same Church, he gave gifts to men, when he ascended up to heaven,
<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_13" id="Ref_13" href="#Foot_13">[13]</a></span><i>some
to be Apostles, some Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some
Pastors and Teachers</i>. As a King, he now sits at Gods right hand,
and is made Head over all things to his Church; which Church is called
the house of God; and who should appoint Orders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">{5}</a></span>
for the Government of the House, but the <i>Lord of
the house</i>? And to say, that he hath not ordained how
his house should be governed, is <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_14" id="Ref_14" href="#Foot_14">[14]</a></span>to
make the Master
less faithfull in his own house, then his Servant <i>Moses</i>
was; which Church is <i>Christs Vineyard</i>, <i>Christs Garden</i>,
and can we think Christ so negligent, as not to appoint
a hedge to fence his Vineyard, and a wall to preserve
his Garden? which Church is a spirituall <i>Republique</i>.
And shall we deny that to <i>Christ</i> in the Government of
his Kingdome, which we grant unto all Earthly <i>Monarchs</i>?
Shall we say, That Christ hath ordained no
Laws, by which his Kingdome shall be governed; no
Censures, by which his rebellious subjects shall be punished;
no Officers to dispence those censures? This is
a high defamation to Jesus Christ, and his <i>Kingly Office</i>.</p>

<p>3. <i>From the immediate, and proper end of Church Government</i>,
which is not only matter of order and decency, but spiritual and
supernatural, being appointed for the <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_15" id="Ref_15" href="#Foot_15">[15]</a></span><i>Edification
of the body of
Christ in grace unto glory</i>; and more particularly, for the
<i>gaining of an offending brother unto repentance, and for the saving
of his soul in the day of the Lord Jesus</i>. Now this is a certain
rule, <i>whatsoever hath a spiritual efficacy, must of necessity have
a divine originall</i>; <i>humane institutions</i> can but produce
humane effects: And therefore, seeing Church Government is designed
for divine and supernaturall ends, it must of necessity, plead its
originall from God himself.</p>

<p>4. We argue from an enumeration of the substantials of
Church-Government. The Word of God declares unto us, That there are
<i>Church-officers</i>, and who they are, <i>viz.</i>, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_16" id="Ref_16" href="#Foot_16">[16]</a></span><i>Pastors
and Teachers</i>, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_17" id="Ref_17" href="#Foot_17">[17]</a></span><i>Ruling-Elders,
and</i> <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_18" id="Ref_18" href="#Foot_18">[18]</a></span><i>Deacons</i>;
And how they are to be <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_19" id="Ref_19" href="#Foot_19">[19]</a></span><i>qualified</i>
for, and <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_20" id="Ref_20" href="#Foot_20">[20]</a></span><i>externally
called</i> unto their respective Offices, together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">{6}</a></span>
with all the Ministerial duties in those Offices, by
them to be performed respectively; as <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_21" id="Ref_21" href="#Foot_21">[21]</a></span><i>publike
prayer</i>, the <i>Ministry of the Word</i>, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_22" id="Ref_22" href="#Foot_22">[22]</a></span><i>by
reading and</i> <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_23" id="Ref_23" href="#Foot_23">[23]</a></span><i>preaching</i>,
the <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_24" id="Ref_24" href="#Foot_24">[24]</a></span>blessing
of the people in the name of the Lord, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_25" id="Ref_25" href="#Foot_25">[25]</a></span><i>Administration
of the Sacraments</i>, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_26" id="Ref_26" href="#Foot_26">[26]</a></span><i>Censures</i>
and <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_27" id="Ref_27" href="#Foot_27">[27]</a></span>distribution
of Alms. The Scripture also tells us of a <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_28" id="Ref_28" href="#Foot_28">[28]</a></span>Church,
consisting of no more then can conveniently meet in
one place to partake in all the Ordinances of publike
Worship: and of <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_29" id="Ref_29" href="#Foot_29">[29]</a></span>a
Church consisting of divers congregations. The Scripture also speaks of <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_30" id="Ref_30" href="#Foot_30">[30]</a></span>Synods,
with Ecclesiasticall Authority, together with the <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_31" id="Ref_31" href="#Foot_31">[31]</a></span>subordination
of the lesser, to the greater, and appeals thereunto.
Now all these are the substantials of Church Government,
and are sufficiently set down in the Word,
as may partly appear by the quotations in the Margent,
and shall further appear by what we shall say afterwards.
And more then these, and such as are necessarily
included in these, are not (as we humbly conceive)
substantials in the outward Government of the
Church. The rest are circumstantialls, for which Christ
hath given general rules sufficient to direct the Church
in the ordering of them, and from which therefore she
may not depart. These rules are set down, 1&nbsp;Cor. 14.26, 40.
<i>Let all things be done unto edifying, decently and in
order</i>, 1&nbsp;Cor. 10.31, 32. <i>Do all to the glory of God</i>, &amp;c.
Rom. 14.19. <i>Let us therefore follow after the things that
make for peace</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The second thing, which with the like brevity and perspicuity, we
shall endeavour to evidence unto you, is, <i>That the Christian
Magistrate, is not the Fountain and Origin of Church-Government</i>.
The former assertion, gave unto <i>God</i>, the things which were <i>Gods</i>;
and this doth not at all take away from <i>Cæsar</i>, the things that are
<i>Cæsars</i>:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">{7}</a></span>
For we freely acknowledg, that <i>Magistracy</i> is an <i>Ordinance
of God</i>, appointed for the great good of mankind;
so that, whoever are enemies to <i>Magistracy</i>, are enemies
to <i>mankind</i>, and <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_32" id="Ref_32" href="#Foot_32">[32]</a></span>to
the <i>revealed Will of God</i>. We desire
to hold up the honour and greatness, the power and authority
of lawful Magistracy, against Papists, Anabaptists,
and all others, that despise dominion, and speak evil
of dignities. We say, that the Magistrate is, in a
civil notion, the supream Governor in all causes Ecclesiastical;
the <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_33" id="Ref_33" href="#Foot_33">[33]</a></span>keeper
of both tables; <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_34" id="Ref_34" href="#Foot_34">[34]</a></span>the
nursing father of the Church: <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_35" id="Ref_35" href="#Foot_35">[35]</a></span>that
it belongs to him, by his Political
power, to reform the Church, when corrupted; to
preserve it, when reformed; to suppresse blasphemy,
idolatry, heresie, schisme, and prophanenesse, and whatsoever
is contrary to godlinesse and sound doctrine; that
the people under him, may lead a quiet life, in all godlinesse
and honesty. <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_36" id="Ref_36" href="#Foot_36">[36]</a></span>That
he is sent of God for the punishment
of evil doers (amongst which, are heretiques, as
well as others, and therefore called evil workers; and
heresies, evil deeds, <i>Phil.</i> 3.2. 2&nbsp;ep.&nbsp;<i>Joh.</i> ver. 11.) and for
the praise of them that do well. That he is the <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_37" id="Ref_37" href="#Foot_37">[37]</a></span><i>Bishop
of those things that are without the Church; as</i> Constantine
<i>stiled himself</i>. That to him belongs to punish Church-Officers,
with civil punishments, when they abuse their
power; and to give protection to the publique exercise
of Church-Government, within his dominions.</p>

<p>But yet, notwithstanding all this, we affirm, That though the
Magistrate be a <i>nursing father</i> of the <i>Church</i>, yet he is not the
<i>begetting father</i>; That the <i>Magistrate</i>, as a <i>Magistrate</i>, is no
<i>Church-Officer</i>, neither are the keyes of the Kingdom of heaven
committed unto him. Neither did Christ ever say to the <i>Kings of the
Earth; whose sins you remit, shall be remitted; and whose sins you
retain</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
<i>shall be retained; and whatsoever you shall binde on earth,
shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever you shall loose on
earth, shall be loosed in heaven.</i> Neither is the offended
brother directed to tell the civil Magistrate, but to tell
the Church. Neither doth it belong to him to preach
the Word, or to administer the Sacraments. Neither
is he, as a Magistrate, seated by Christ in his Church,
but is to be subject to the Church in all spiritual things,
as a member thereof. Neither is it in his power to appoint
what Government he please in the Church; no
more then what Religion he please. And this we prove:</p>

<p>1. Because <i>Jesus Christ</i> (as hath been already shewed) hath
appointed a <i>particular Church-Government in his Word</i>, to be
observed by all Kingdoms and States immutably, and unalterably, for
the substantials of it.</p>

<p>2. Because the <i>Church of Christ had a Government within it self for
300 years before it had a Christian Magistrate</i>. The Scripture
tells us, that the Church, in the Apostles dayes, had power to meet
for ordering Church-affairs, for excommunicating scandalous offenders,
and obstinate heretiques. And this power was not derived to them, from
the <i>Magistrate</i>, being then Heathen; nor were they Traytors and
Rebels against the State, in challenging this power. And when the
<i>Magistrate</i>, afterwards, became Christian, the Church did not
lose that power which it had before, when he was heathen. For the
truth is, when a <i>heathen Magistrate becomes a Christian, he doth
not acquire more Authority over the Church of Christ, then he had
before, no more then a heathen husband converted, doth over his wife,
which he married, when unconverted</i>. A Magistrate, by becoming
Christian, is better inabled to do service to Christ, and his right is
sanctified to him; but his <i>Authority</i> is no greater then it was
before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span>
3. Because the power of the Magistrate, in reference to the power of
the Church, is not <i>privative</i> of the Churches power, but
<i>cumulative</i> and <i>additional</i>. For if it were otherwise,
then the condition of the Church should be worse under a
<i>Constantine</i>, then under a <i>Nero</i>; under a <i>Christian
Magistrate</i>, then under a <i>Heathen</i>; which is contrary to all those
Scriptures, which tell us <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_38" id="Ref_38" href="#Foot_38">[38]</a></span>what
glorious advantages the Church should
have, by the Magistrates becoming Christian; and that the Magistrate
shall bring honour and glory to the new <i>Jerusalem</i>, and not take
away that power that properly belongs to the new <i>Jerusalem</i>.</p>

<p>4. Because that this assertion, denyeth an <i>intrinsecall power</i>
to the Church, to preserve it self in unity, to purge out spiritual
defilements, and to take care for its own preservation against
<i>Church-destroying enemies, and iniquities</i>; which makes the
happinesse of the Church wholly to depend upon the civil Magistrate;
and is contrary, not only to the nature of the Church<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_39" id="Ref_39" href="#Foot_39">[39]</a></span>,
but of all other <i>societies</i>, which have a <i>power</i> within themselves, of
<i>self-preservation</i>; and is contrary to the experience of former
ages, which tell us, <i>That the Church of Christ did flourish more in
truth and holinesse</i>, (though not in wealth and honours,) <i>whilest it
was under Heathen persecuting Emperours, then afterwards</i>. From the
Apostles, even unto the dregs of our time, the Church of Christ, both
in its infancy and fuller growth, increased by persecutions, and was
crowned by Martyrdoms: But after it had Christian Princes, indeed it
was greater in power and riches, but lesse in piety, saith
<i>Jerome</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_40" id="Ref_40" href="#Foot_40">[40]</a></span>.</p>

<p>5. Because that this opinion, <i>That the Magistrate is the Fountain
of all Church-power, derives upon the Christian Magistrate most of
that power, which the Pope did formerly</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
<i>most unjustly and tyrannically usurp over the Churches of
Jesus Christ</i>; and thereby makes the Christian Magistrate
to become a <i>Political Pope</i>, and sets up a <i>civil Antichrist</i>
instead of a spiritual, for one great part of <i>Antichristianisme</i>
consisteth in the Popes making himself to
be the <i>Original of all spiritual jurisdiction</i>.</p>

<p>And thus we have given you a short account of the first opinion; and
we do beseech you, in the Name of our <i>Lord Jesus Christ</i>, that
you would weigh what we have said, in the ballance of the Sanctuary; &amp;
that you would look upon Church-Government, as an Ordinance of God,
flowing unto you in the bloud of Christ, and as part of his <i>Kingly
Office</i>; That you would allow of no <i>Church-officers</i>, or
<i>Offices</i>, that have not a <i>divine stamp</i> upon them, accounting
them guilty of a <i>spiritual Præmunire</i>, that will undertake an office
in the Church, if there cannot be shewed a <i>Scripture-warrant</i>
for it; and that you would submit unto it for conscience sake.</p>

<p>The second opinion, is of those, that will confesse a <i>particular
Church-Government by divine right</i>; but say, that this is not the
<i>Presbyteriall</i>, but the Government commonly called
<i>Independent</i>, or <i>Congregationall</i>: the truth is, There are four
kinds of Church-Government which lay claim to a <i>jus divinum</i>;
The <i>Papal</i>, <i>Prelatical</i>, <i>Independent</i>, and <i>Presbyterial</i>.
The first of them was banished out of this Kingdom, by King Hen. the
8. The second of them, as it was used and practised in this land, is
abjured by our Covenant. The great debate of these late years, hath
been about the <i>Presbyterial</i>, and <i>Independent Government</i>.
And though we do not intend at this time, to enter into a large
dispute; yet we earnestly desire our Brethren, that differ from us
only in point of Church-Government, to consider the wofull mischiefs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">{11}</a></span>
that have come upon the Churches of Christ in
<i>England</i>, by their dividing, and separating from us: And
that whilest we have been <i>disputing</i> what is that <i>Government</i>
which Christ hath appointed in his <i>Word</i>, there are
a prevailing party risen up, that will have no <i>Government</i>
at all to be found in the <i>Word</i>: whilest we have been so
long <i>debating</i> about the <i>hedge</i>, the wild Beasts have got
in, and made spoyl of the <i>Vineyard it self</i>: Whilest we
have been building the wall, others have been <i>plucking
down the house</i>: Whilest we have been consulting about
the <i>Garment of Christ</i>, others have taken advantage to
deny the <i>Divinity of Christ</i>: Whilest we have been so
tediously contending about <i>Reforming of Churches</i>, <i>Ordination
of Ministers</i>; and <i>purity of Ordinances</i>, there are
men risen up, that deny all <i>Ministry, Ordinances, and
Churches</i>. And indeed, there is scarce any fundamental
Doctrine in Christian Religion, but is now, not only
called in question, but openly denyed by some, or other.
And therefore, we do exhort our <i>Brethren</i>, in the
name of our <i>Lord Jesus Christ</i>, that they would sadly
lay to heart the unexpressible calamities, which are
brought upon our Churches, by their dividing from us;
and that they would study, for the time to come, all
wayes of <i>Union and Accommodation</i>: And for our parts,
we do here profess to all the World, that we are, have
alwayes been, and through the grace of God, shall ever
be willing to study to find out any <i>Scripture way</i>, wherein
we may <i>unite</i> together with them, for the preservation
of the <i>Truths of Jesus Christ</i>, the prevention of a <i>toleration
of Heresies and Blasphemies</i>, and for the healing of
the great <i>scandal</i> that is given to <i>weak Christians, and
wicked men</i>, by our unhappy <i>differences and divisions</i>.</p>

<p>As for the <i>Presbyterial Government</i> it self, we may justly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span>
say of it, as the Jews did upon another occasion, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_41" id="Ref_41" href="#Foot_41">[41]</a></span><i>we
know that every where it is spoken against</i>; and that men deal with it, and
Us that profess it, as the <i>old persecutors</i> dealt with the
<i>Christians</i>; when they put them into <i>Bear-skins</i>, and then baited
them with dogs; and as the <i>Papists</i> dealt with <i>John Hus</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_42" id="Ref_42" href="#Foot_42">[42]</a></span>,
when they <i>pinned a paper, with the picture of red Devils, upon his head, and
then exposed him to the laughter of the people</i>. Some say, That it
is a <i>lordly, Domineering government</i>; and that if we had our
wills, we would <i>lord</i> it over the people of Christ, more then
ever the <i>Prelates</i> did; and instead of one Bishop in a Diocess,
we should have many hundreds. Others say, that it is a Tyrannical and
cruel government, and if it were once established, it would fine and
imprison all that would not yeeld to it. Others, that we require an
Arbitrary power, and challenge an illimited jurisdiction. Others,
that we have a design to free our selves from being under the power of
the civil Magistrate. Others, that this government doth rob the
Congregational Churches of their power and liberty, no lesse then
Prelacy did, so that the Church in removing of Prelacy, changed not
<i>Dominium</i>, but <i>Dominum</i>. Others, that we seek for <i>unity</i>,
but neglect <i>purity</i>. Others accuse us, that we contend too
earnestly for <i>purity</i>, because we will not admit men to the
Sacrament, before they give an account to the Minister and Elders of
their fitness thereunto. Others accuse us, for stamping a <i>jus
divinum</i> upon our government; and others on the contrary, declaim
against us, because we do not assert a <i>jus divinum</i>, but depend
upon a <i>jus humanum</i>; depend more upon an <i>Ordinance of
Parliament</i> for our establishment, then an <i>Ordinance of God</i>.
Others exclaim against us, that we are now become the only
<i>troublers of Israel</i>, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
the only <i>hinderers</i> of a <i>blessed and glorious Reformation</i>;
That we are <i>pestilent fellowes</i>, <i>movers of sedition among
the people</i>, causers of the first war between <i>King and
Parliament</i>, and of all the murders and blood-shedings,
that have been in the Nation for these many years;
That we were the Authors and abettors of that violence
that was offered to the Parliament, <i>July 6. 1647</i>.
That the Ministers of <i>London</i> are Pulpit-Incendiaries,
and have separated their consecrated lungs, for Bellows,
to blow up the fire of a second War the last year; that
they were the bringers in of that numerous Army out of
<i>Scotland</i>, to invade the <i>Parliament</i> and <i>Army</i> of <i>England</i>:
Others say, that we are Apostatized from our principles,
and are turned <i>Malignants</i>, that we that were once
the great <i>Parliament Assertors</i>, are now become the only
<i>Parliament-Opposers</i>. Lastly, that the <i>Presbyterian Ministers</i>
seek their own private ease and interest, and not
the things of Jesus Christ; That they are notorious
hypocrites, <i>Baals</i> Priests, limbs of Antichrist. And
that the only reason why they dislike, and expresse an
unsatisfiednesse with these times, and the alterations
therein made, is, because they fear, that their great <i>Diana
of tythes will be pulled down, and that their gains will
be lesse, and their pains greater; and that they cannot lord it
over their people, as they hoped to have done</i>.</p>

<p>These are the <i>Bear-skins</i> in which we are put from day to day;
these are the <i>red Devils</i> that are pinned upon us, to render our
persons, <i>Ministry</i>, and <i>Government</i> odious unto the people. But
our comfort is, that these accusations are meer calumnies and
slanders, and that there is not the least shadow of reality or truth
in them. And it is an evident token to us, that <i>God hath some great
work for us to do, because he suffers the red dragon to</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">{14}</a></span>
<i>pour out such floods of reproaches upon us</i>; and that our <i>government
is of Divine Original, because it is so much opposed</i>,
and that by all sorts of men, and that in contrary
ways: some opposing it, because it seeks so much after
<i>purity of ordinances</i>; others, because it seeks it not enough:
some, because it layeth claim so much to a <i>jus divinum</i>;
Others, <i>because not enough</i>.</p>

<p>We well remember, and are therein much comforted, what
<i>Tertullian</i> saith; <i>That that religion must needs be good
which Nero persecuted</i>; and what <i>Spanhemius that late learned
Professor of Leyden</i>, in his history of the original, and progress
of the Anabaptists of <i>Germany</i>, tells us, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_43" id="Ref_43" href="#Foot_43">[43]</a></span><i>That
when God raised up Luther, Melancthon, Zuinglius, and divers other Worthies, to
be the Reformers of his Church; At the same time, the enemy of mankind
raised up the Anabaptists, to be the disturbers of his Church. That
Thomas Muntzer their great Antesignanus, when he could not get Luther
to joyn with him, but on the contrary was rebuked by him, and
earnestly admonished not to disturb the publique peace, &amp;c. He began
to rise up, and thunder against Luther himself, crying out, that
Luther was as much in fault, as the Pope of Rome; that it was true,
the work of reformation was somewhat furthered by him, but left still
infected with much leaven; yea that Luther was worse then the Pope,
for that he had published only a carnall Gospel.</i> And afterwards,
When <i>Luther</i>, <i>Melancthon</i>, <i>Zuinglius</i>, <i>Bullinger</i>, <i>Menius</i>, <i>Regius</i>,
and others, began, by writing, to defend both their own, and the cause
of the Church of God, and to wipe off the blot that was cast as well
upon themselves as upon the Gospel, by these Anabaptists; <i>Muntzer</i>
and his confederates were the more enraged against them, crying out,
<i>That Luther, and those of his party, favoured nothing but the
flesh, vaunting indeed, that they had cut off some of the leaves of
Antichrist, but the tree, and the roots remained still untouched,
which must also be cut down, and which cut down they would. And
because they could finde nothing in the</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>
<i>written Word, to defend their errours, and the tumults which they
raised, they fly to revelations, and inspirations &amp;c. Hereupon
every Fish-monger begins to boast of the spirit, feign revelations
after the example of Storch and Muntzer; The Pulpit is open
to every Cobler or Tinker. They scoffed at the publique Sermons
of the reformed, inveighed against the Lutherane Faith, as being
void of good works, &amp;c. Muntzer, the chiefe trumpet of these
uproars, proclaims openly, that he was raised up by the command
of God, for the punishment of wicked Princes, and altering of Politick
government. His usual subscription to his letters was</i>,
Thomas Muntzer, <i>the servant of God against the ungodly</i>. What
was the fatal end of this <i>Muntzer</i>, and of <i>Iohn Becold</i> the
Taylor of <i>Leyden</i>, and of the rest of that crew; what prodigious
opinions they held, he that will, may read them in the
forementioned Author. There are two reasons have
moved us to cite this story: First, to shew, <i>That it is not
unusual with God, when he raiseth up men faithful in their
generation to reform his Church</i>, to give way to the enemy
of mankind, for the trial of his people, to raise up
some men even amongst the Reformers themselves,
that by spreading of errours and Heresies, and State-disturbing
opinions, should endeavour to obstruct the
Reformation so happily begun. Secondly, that in <i>times
of Reformation</i>, it hath alwayes been the practice of the
Ring-leaders of Errours and Heresies, to inveigh more
bitterly, and write more railingly against the Reformers
of the Church, and the Reformation by them indeavoured,
then against the common adversary, both
of themselves, of the Reformers, and of the Reformation.
And this is our lot and portion at this day.</p>

<p>But yet, notwithstanding all this, we hope, that if this <i>Presbyteriall
Government</i>, so much opposed both by <i>Malignants, and Sectaries of all
sorts</i>, were once presented unto our congregations in its true and
native colours, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
would be embraced by all that fear God amongst us;
and that we might say of it, as once it was said of <i>Socrates</i>,
<i>That all that knew him, loved him; and the reason
why any did not love him, was only because they did not know
him</i>. And we likewise hope, that if we shall fully
answer the accusations that are brought against us, in
the bitter and lying pamphlets of this licentious age,
that then our persons also shall stand right in the hearts
and consciences of all that truly fear God within this
Kingdome. Give us leave, therefore to undertake these
two things.</p>

<p>First, <i>To represent the Presbyteriall-Government before you, in its
true beauty and excellency</i>.</p>

<p>Secondly, <i>To vindicate our persons from the slanders and cruell
reproaches that are cast upon them</i>.</p>

<p>1. For the <i>Vindication of our Government</i>, and therein the
undeceiving of our people, who look upon it; as it is misrepresented
unto them, by those that are enemies unto Us, Them, and the
Government, we shall offer briefly these ensuing particulars.</p>

<p>1. That the <i>Presbyteriall-Government</i> is a Government that hath
been the fruit of the prayers of many thousands of godly people in
<i>England</i>, in Queen <i>Elizabeth's</i>, and King <i>Iames</i> his dayes: There
were many knowing Christians, and faithfull Ministers, that made it
their frequent prayer, that God would reform <i>England</i> in Discipline,
as he had done in Doctrine; and the Discipline then they prayed for,
and many suffered for, was the <i>Presbyterian</i>; as appears by
the books written in those days<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_44" id="Ref_44" href="#Foot_44">[44]</a></span>.
<i>And shall we now despise that
mercy that comes swimming to us in the prayers of so many thousand
Saints?</i></p>

<p>2. Though the Presbyterian-Government (for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">{17}</a></span>
practice of it) be new and strange to us in <i>England</i>, yet
it is not new.</p>

<p>First, To the Churches of Christ in other Countries: For most of those
places that did thrust out the Popish Religion, and Government, did
receive in the Protestant Religion, and Presbyterial-Government. It is
not new to the Protestant Reformed Churches in <i>France</i>, <i>Scotland</i>,
<i>Netherlands</i>, and <i>Geneva</i>, and divers other places, who have had
comfortable experience of this Government, and have enjoyed a great
deal of liberty, verity, piety, unity, and prosperity under it: And
(which we desire all our respective Congregations seriously to
consider) therefore it is (as we humbly conceive) that the framers of
our <i>National Covenant</i> did put in these words, <i>And the example
of the best Reformed Churches</i>, into the first Article of the
Covenant, that thereby they might hint unto us, what that Government
was, which is neerest the Word, even that which is now practised in
the best Reformed Churches.</p>

<p>2. <i>To the Word of God</i>; but is there to be found in all
the <i>substantials</i> of it, as we have briefly shewed already,
and some of our own <i>Brethren Ministers</i> of this City,
have made to appear at large, in a Book, entituled, <i>The
divine Right of the Presbyterial Government</i>. We shall
speak a little more to three of the forementioned <i>Substantials
of Church-Government</i>: And shall prove,</p>

<p>1. <i>That the Scripture holds forth a Church, consisting of divers
Congregations.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>Synods with Ecclesiastical Authority.</i></p>

<p>3. <i>Subordination of Congregations unto Synods, together with
Appeals thereunto.</i></p>

<p>1. <i>That the Scripture holds forth a Church consisting of
divers Congregations.</i> Such a Church was</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">{18}</a></span>
The <i>Church of Jerusalem</i>; as appears,</p>

<p>1. By the <i>Multitude of Believers</i>, both before, and after the
dispersion (mentioned, <i>Act.</i> 8.1.) <i>Act.</i> 2.41, 46, 47.
<i>Act.</i> 4.4. <i>Act.</i> 5.14. <i>Act.</i> 6.1, 7. <i>Act.</i>
9.31.<i> Act.</i> 12.24. <i>Act.</i> 21.20.</p>

<p>2. By the many <i>Apostles</i>, and other <i>Preachers</i> in the
<i>Church</i> of <i>Jerusalem</i>: If there were but one Congregation
there, each Apostle preached but seldom, which will not consist with
<i>Act.</i> 6.2.</p>

<p>3. The <i>diversity of Languages</i> amongst the Believers, mentioned
both in the second and sixt Chapters of the <i>Acts</i>, doth argue
more Congregations then one in that Church.</p>

<p>All which, are fully and largely handled by the <i>Reverend Assembly
of Divines</i> in a book of theirs, printed by Authority of Parliament.</p>

<p>2. <i>That the Scripture speaks of Synods with Ecclesiastical
Authority</i>, this is evident from <i>Act.</i> 15. in which Chapter,
two things are to be observed:</p>

<p>1. <i>That the Apostles in that Meeting, did not act as Apostles with
infallible authority, but as Elders, in such a way as makes that
Meeting, a pattern for ordinary Synods.</i></p>

<p>For the proof of this, we offer these reasons.</p>

<p>1. Because <i>Paul</i> and <i>Barnabas</i> did willingly submit to be
sent from <i>Antioch</i> to <i>Jerusalem</i>, which they needed not
have done (one of them at least being an Apostle) nor could have done,
had they acted as Apostles, and not as Members, for that time, of the
<i>Presbytery of Antioch</i>, <i>Act.</i> 15.2.</p>

<p>2. Because <i>Paul</i> and <i>Barnabas</i> were sent not only to the
Apostles at <i>Jerusalem</i>, but to the Apostles and Elders, which at
that time were not a few (the Believers in <i>Jerusalem</i> being many
thousands) which proves, that they sent not unto the <i>Apostles as
extraordinary and infallible</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>
(for then what need the advice of the Elders?) but as
wise and holy Guides of the Church, who might not
only relieve them by some wise counsel, but also <i>set a
president</i> unto succeeding Ages, how <i>Errours and Dissentions</i>
in the Church might be removed and healed; as
Mr. <i>Cotton</i> observes, in his book of the <i>Keyes</i>, &amp;c. pag. 23.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. <i>Cotton</i> of the <i>Keyes</i>.</div>

<p>3. Because in the Synod, the Apostles did not determine the thing in
question, by <i>Apostolical Authority</i>, from immediate revelation,
but assembled together with the Elders to consider of the matter,
<i>Act.</i> 15.6. and a Multitude of the Brethren together with them,
<i>Act.</i> 15.12, 22, 23. And there the question was stated, and
debated from Scripture in an ordinary way. <i>Peter</i> proves it by
the <i>witnesse of the Spirit to his Ministry, in</i> Cornelius <i>his
Family, Paul</i> and <i>Barnabas</i> by the like effect of their
Ministry amongst the Gentiles. <i>James</i> confirmed the same by the
testimony of the Prophets; with which, the whole Synod being
satisfied, they determine of a judicial sentence, and of a way to
publish it by letters and messages.</p>

<p>4. Because the Decrees of the Synod are put forth in the name, <i>not
only of the Apostles, but of the Apostles and Elders</i>, <i>Act.</i>
15.22, 23. <i>Act.</i> 16.4. <i>Act.</i> 21.25.</p>

<p>The second thing to be observed in that Chapter, is,</p>

<p><i>That the Apostles and Elders did put forth Acts of Ecclesiasticall
Authority in that Synod.</i> This appears plainly from <i>Act.</i>
15.28. <i>to lay no other burden</i>. To bind burdens, is an <i>act of
the binding power of the Keyes</i>. And it appears likewise from
<i>Act.</i> 16.4. where mention is made of <i>Decrees ordained by the
Apostles &amp; Elders</i>. And it is observeable, that wheresoever
<span title="dogma">δογμα</span>, is used in the <i>New Testament</i>, it is put either for
<i>Decrees</i> or <i>Laws</i>, and so frequently by the <i>Septuagint
in the old Testament</i>, as is abundantly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>
proved by the Reverend <i>Assembly of Divines</i>, in their
answer to the Reasons of the Dissenting-Brethren, against
the instance of the Church of <i>Jerusalem</i>, pag. 66.</p>

<p>3. That the Scripture holds forth a subordination of Congregations
unto Synods, together with Appeals thereunto. To prove this, we will
bring two places: The first is <i>Deut.</i> 17.8. to 12. together with
2&nbsp;<i>Chron.</i> 19.8, 10, 11. Out of which two places, compared
together, we gather these two conclusions:</p>

<p>1. <i>That the Jews had two supream Judicatories in Jerusalem</i>; the
one <i>Ecclesiasticall</i>, for the <i>matters of the Lord</i>; the
other <i>civill</i>, for the <i>matters of the King</i>. This appears
by <i>Deut.</i> 17. ver. 8. where we have a distinction of causes;
some <i>forensicall</i> between <i>blood</i> and <i>blood</i>,
belonging to the civil <i>Judicatory</i>; some ceremonial, between
stroak, and stroak; that is, (as not only <i>Hierome</i>, but the
Chaldy and Septuagint read the words, and as appears by the frequent
use of the word in that sense, <i>Levit.</i> 13. and elsewhere,)
between leprosie, and leprosie, belonging to the cognizance of the
Ecclesiastical Judicatory. And in the 12 verse, these two Judicatories
are distinguished, by the disjunctive <i>Or</i>; <i>And the man that will do
presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the Priest</i>, (that
standeth to minister before the Lord thy God,) <i>or unto the
Judge</i>, &amp;c. This further appears, by 2&nbsp;<i>Chr.</i> 19.8, 10, 11. In
which we have clear mention; first of two sorts of Judges, the
<i>Levites and Priests, and chief of the Fathers</i>, vers. 8.
secondly, of two sorts of causes, some <i>spirituall and
Ecclesiasticall</i>, called the <i>judgment of the Lord</i>, ver. 8.
and the <i>matters of the Lord</i>, ver. 11. others civill, as
<i>between blood and blood</i>, ver. 10. And thirdly, of two
<i>Presidents</i>; <i>Amariah</i> the chief <i>Priest</i>, in all <i>matters
of the Lord</i>; and <i>Zebadiah</i> the Ruler of the house of
<i>Judah</i>, in all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
<i>matters of the King</i>. And this distinction between the civil
and Ecclesiastical Judicatory, is the opinion of many
Orthodox &amp; learned Authors, which are cited by Mr.
<i>Gelaspy</i>, <i>Aarons</i> rod blossom, cap. 3. pag. 8. where this
conclusion is largely and learnedly debated &amp; asserted.</p>

<p>2. <i>That there was a subordination in the Jewish Church, of the
Synagogues, in all hard and difficult controversies, and in all the
matters of the Lord, unto the Ecclesiastical Judicatory at Jerusalem,
and appeals thereunto</i>; this appears evidently, <i>Deut.</i> 17.8,
9. 2&nbsp;Chron. 19.8, 10.</p>

<p>Now that this <i>Subordination</i>, together with <i>appeals</i>, did
not belong to the <i>Jewish Church</i>, as <i>Jewish</i> only, but as
it was an <i>Ecclesiastical Republique</i>, is evident. For though the
<i>high Priest</i>, amongst the Jews, was a <i>type of Christ</i>, yet
these <i>gradual Judicatories</i>, wherein the <i>aggrieved party did
appeal, from the lesser to the greater; (that against the very light
of nature, the adverse party might not be the sole Judge and party
too, in his own cause) were not in any kind ceremonial or typicall</i>.</p>

<p><i>Appeals</i>, (saith Dr. <i>Whitaker</i>,) <i>they are of divine and
natural light, and certainly very necessary in every necessity,
because of the iniquity and ignorance of Judges</i>, Whit. Contr. 4.
de Romano Pontific. lib. 4. cap. 2. And generally, all <i>Protestant
Writers</i> against appeals to the Pope, acknowledge yet, their
necessary usefulness to a <i>Synod</i>. So did that renowned Martyr
<i>Cranmer</i>, the form of whose appeal to a Council, three several
times urged by him, with much instance, we have recorded by Mr.
<i>Foxe</i> at large, Acts and Monuments.</p>

<p>And indeed, if the <i>benefit of appeals, and consociation of
Churches</i>, should not be as free to us, as to the <i>Jews</i>, how
much <i>more defective &amp; improvident</i> were the <i>Gospel</i>, then
the <i>Law</i>, contrary to all <i>ancient Prophesies of Gospel-Communion</i>?
How were <i>our Saviour King of Peace and Righteousnesse</i>,
should he have ordained now under the <i>Gospel</i>
such a <i>government</i>, as by making <i>Parties sole Judges</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span>
were neither <i>righteous, nor peaceable</i>? what <i>Judaicall
type or ceremony</i>, can there be in this communion and
mutual assistance in government, which God (as by his
Word, so) by the very light of nature, teacheth all societies
whatsoever, whether Common-Wealth, Armies,
Universities, or Navies? &amp;c. as learnedly Mr. <i>Herle</i>, in
his Independency, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The second place is Matth. 18.15, 16, 17, 18. which text, by a
<i>parity of reason</i>, proves a <i>subordination of Congregations unto Synods</i>.
For there is the same relation between <i>Church and Church</i>,
as between<i> brother and brother</i>; and if a <i>brother</i> offending is <i>subordinate</i>
unto a <i>particular Congregation</i>; then by a <i>like reason</i>,
an <i>offending Congregation</i> is <i>subordinate</i> unto <i>greater Assemblies</i>.
And the reason of it is, because the <i>grounds</i>, <i>reasons</i>, and <i>ends</i> of
<i>subordination</i>, are the same in both. <i>That God might be glorified,
the offendor shamed, humbled, reduced, and sin not suffered to rest
upon him. That others may be preserved from contagion, and made
to fear. That scandal and pollution of the Ordinances, may be prevented,
or removed.</i> All which argue as strongly and fully for
<i>subordination of an offending Congregation to superiour and greater
Assemblies, as of an offending brother to a particular Congregation</i>:
And the truth is, whosoever denyes the subordination of a Congregation
unto a Synod, together with appeals thereunto, doth
in plain tearms affirm these three things,</p>

<p>1. <i>That the Government of Christ in his Church under the New
Testament, is a Government directly contrary to the very light of
nature making the same men parties, and finall Judges in their own
cause.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>That the Government of the Church in the Old Testament,
was more equal and just, then under the New.</i></p>

<p>3. <i>That Jesus Christ hath in his Government appointed no effectual
remedy to heal the scandals of an offending Congregation, or
at least, a more effectual remedy to redresse an offending Brother,
then an offending Congregation.</i> All which are great <i>derogations</i>,
and <i>disparagements</i> to the <i>Kingly Office and Government of Jesus
Christ</i>. And thus we have shewed that the Presbyterial Government
is not new to the Word of God, as some falsly object.
We proceed to justifie it in other particulars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">{23}</a></span>
3. The Presbyterial Government <i>challengeth no power
over mens bodies or estates</i>. It medleth not in civil affairs,
or with inflicting civil mulcts, or corporal punishments.
It is a government <i>purely spirituall</i>, dispensing the Keyes
of the <i>Kingdom of heaven</i>, not of earth; and how then
can it be cruel and tyrannical, in fineing and imprisoning
mens persons, as was objected?</p>

<p>4. It is not a <i>Government</i> that hath <i>Lordships</i> and great
<i>Revenues</i> annexed to it, as the Prelatical had. It is not
<i>gainful</i> and <i>profitable</i>, but <i>burdensome</i> and <i>troublesome</i>:
What do the ruling Elders gain by their office, but
reproach and contempt? And is not the condition of the
teaching Elder worse, in regard of maintenance, since
he ingaged in this discipline, then ever it was? This is
a government that hath no outward advantages to induce
men to accept of it. <i>It is conscience</i>, and (as we
hope) <i>pure conscience</i>, that ingageth any in it, and <i>therefore
it is, that it hath so few friends, because there are so
few that are truly conscientious</i>.</p>

<p>5. It is not a <i>Domineering Hierarchicall magisteriall
Government, that lords it over peoples consciences, requiring
subjection to the decrees of it, with blind and slavish obedience</i>.
But it is a <i>Stewardship</i>, a <i>Ministry</i>, a painful and
laborious service. We say, That all the determinations,
even of Nationall Synods, are to be obeyed no
further, then they agree with the Word of God. And
that a Synod is <i>Judex judicandus</i>. That Congregations
are to examine with the judgment of discretion,
what is sent to them from Synods. There is <i>no more
obedience required to the Decrees of a Nationall Synod, then
the Independents claim to the decrees of a particular Congregation</i>.</p>

<p>6. It is not an <i>Arbitrary illimited Government, but</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>
<i>bounded and limited</i>: 1. <i>By the Word of God</i>; for in this
Government, everything is to be administred according
to the pattern in the Mount. We desire none to
follow, but where the Word goeth before. 2. <i>By the
civill Magistrate</i>, in regard of the exercise of it. For
we acknowledg our selves (as we have said) accountable
to the civill Magistrate, to punish us with civil
mulcts, if we abuse our power.</p>

<p>7. It is not a <i>Government, that doth rob and spoyl particular
Congregations of their just power and priviledges, but
helps and strengthens them</i>. For it is not (as the Prelatical
was) <i>extrinsecall</i> to the severall Congregations;
(which had no vote in the government, nor consent to
it, but were sufferers only of it, and under it:) Neither
doth it assume to it self the <i>sole power of Ordination and
jurisdiction</i>: (as the Prelatical likewise did, and in this,
was lordly and tyrannical over all particular Congregations
in each Diocess:) But it is <i>intrinsecall to the Congregation</i>,
consisting of the Pastors and Elders of every
Congregation, governing one another by their own
Officers: For we hold (which few of our Adversaries
will understand or consider) <i>That all Congregations are
equal</i>. No one Congregation over another. <i>That all
Ministers are equall</i>, No one Minister, by divine right,
over another.</p>

<div class="sidenote">That which concerns all, must be managed by all.</div>

<p>We hold no <i>Mother-Church</i>, on which all other
Churches should depend. But our Government, so far
as it is distinct from the Congregational, consisteth of <i>divers
Sister-Churches, combined by mutuall concernment, and governing
one another in matters of mutuall concernment,
by the common agreement of Pastors and Elders</i>, according
to that Golden Rule, <i>Quod omnes tangit, ab omnibus
tractari debet</i>. In the Presbyterial Government every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span>
Congregation hath a voyce, by the Pastors and Elders
thereof, and so is governed by a <i>power intrinsecall to it
self, which cannot in its own nature be tyrannicall</i>. Though
there is no power in the world so just, but by abuse may
prove tyrannicall.</p>

<p>To illustrate this by a simile. <i>The Presbyterial Government
is like the Government of the</i> City <i>by the</i> Common-councell,
<i>wherein there are</i> Common-Councell-men <i>sent from every</i>
Ward, <i>to judg and determine of matters, that concern the good of
the whole</i> City; <i>which certainly in its own nature, cannot be prejudicall
to the severall</i> Wards, <i>but every helpfull and commodious;
whereas the</i> Prelatical-Government, <i>was just as if the City
should be governed by a</i> High-Commission <i>chosen of</i> Forreiners;
<i>and the</i> Independent-Government <i>is just as if every</i> Ward
<i>should undertake to govern it self, divided from one another, and
not at all to be under the power and authority of the</i> Common-councell.</p>

<p>Adde besides this, the <i>Presbyteriall-Government</i> doth give unto
people of particular Congregations all that is by Christ left them.
For,</p>

<p>1. We allow unto every Congregation a particular Eldership, where it
may be had.</p>

<p>2. We impose upon no Congregation a Minister against whom they can
give a rationall dissent.</p>

<p>3. We allow the Congregationall Eldership to judg in all matters which
concern that particular Church; and to keep from the Sacrament of the
Lords Supper, all those whom they finde to be ignorant or scandalous.</p>

<p>4. In the <i>great Censure of Excommunication</i>, we say,
That it ought not to be <i>executed against the consent of
that particular Congregation, to which the party to be excommunicated
belongs</i>. And in all other matters of
importance, the Presbyterian-Government hath great respect
to that Congregation which is particularly concerned
therein. And therefore, it is so far from <i>robbing</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>
that it is a great <i>Pillar to uphold and support Congregational
Government</i>; as for example:</p>

<p>1. When a particular Congregation is destitute of a Minister, then the
Neighbour-Ministers of the Classis help what in them lies to make up
that defect, by sending supply in the mean time, and afterwards by
joyning in the ordination of another.</p>

<p>2. When there is an insufficient Eldership, then the Classical
Presbytery contributes light and strength.</p>

<p>3. When an Eldership proves Heretical, then the Classical Presbytery
helps to convince them of their Heresies, which the people are not
able ordinarily to do, and thereby to preserve the Congregation from
spiritual contagion.</p>

<p>4. When any member is wronged by the Eldership, the Classis, or Synod,
contributes ayd and relief, as will appear further in the next
particular.</p>

<p>8. The Presbyterial-Government <i>is so far from being
tyrannical, as that it is the greatest remedy against Church-tyranny,
because it is as a city of refuge for all those that are
oppressed in their particular Congregations, to fly unto</i>. For
under the Congregational-Government, when a brother
is (as he conceives) wronged by the major part of
the Church of which he is a member, he is for ever
lock't up, and hath no authoritative way to relieve himself.
(Indeed, he hath moral wayes, by advice and
counsel, which are altogether insufficient;) But the
Presbyterian-Government is a <i>Zoar</i>, and an <i>Ark</i> for the
wronged party to fly unto, from the Particular Congregation,
to a Classical, Provinciall, or National Assembly.
Give us leave to shew you the difference by
this example: Suppose in the civil Government every
Corporation should plead a <i>power independent</i> from a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">{27}</a></span>
<i>Parliament</i>, and challenge to be unaccountable, would
not this make as many <i>Parliaments</i>, as <i>Corporations</i>?
And if any member should be wronged by the major
part of the Corporation to which he belongs, were he
not left without remedy? And if these Corporations
should cry down the <i>Parliaments</i> power over them as
tyrannical, would it not be said, that this is therefore
only done, that they themselves might become petty
Tyrants? So is it here;</p>

<p>The <i>Congregationall Government</i> is a <i>Spiritual Corporation</i>
independent from all other <i>Ecclesiasticall Assemblies</i>
in point of <i>Church-power</i>. As the <i>Pope</i> claims a
power over all <i>Church-Assemblies</i>, so this claims an exemption
from the power of all <i>Church-Assemblies</i>, and
cryeth down all <i>Classical</i>, <i>Provinciall</i>, or <i>Nationall-Assemblies</i>
with power, as tyrannical; but is not this, that in
the mean time it may become absolute, and as it were a
petty Tyranny?</p>

<p>There are in the Congregational Government these
six great defects, besides many others which we could
name.</p>

<p>1. There is (as hath been said) no <i>authoritative way to
relieve a Brother oppressed by the major part of his Congregation</i>,
which granted, would make the Government of
Christ in the <i>New Testament</i>, to be inferiour to the <i>Jewish
Government</i>, in which they had the liberty of Appeals.
And also to be against the <i>light of right reason</i>,
in making the same men to be parties and judges in
their own cause, (as hath been formerly shewed.)</p>

<p>2. There is no <i>authoritative way</i> to heal the major part
of a Congregation, when it falls into fundamental errours,
which is a great disparagement to the Government
of Jesus Christ, and reflects deeply upon the wisdome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
and care of the great King of his Church. <i>For it
makes Christ to provide a more efficatious remedy to cure an
erring member, (to wit, by the great Ordinance of excommunication,)
then an erring Church.</i></p>

<p>3. There is no <i>Authoritative way</i> to keep out pluralities
of Religions. For if the whole <i>power</i> of Church-Government
be in the <i>Congregation-Independently</i>, then
let a Congregation set up what Religion they think fit,
there is no <i>Authoritative Church-remedy</i> left to hinder
them.</p>

<p>4. There is no <i>Authoritative way for unity and uniformity in
Church-administrations</i>, which doth inevitably lay stumbling blocks
before weak Christians, and holds them in suspence, not knowing to
what Congregation to joyn, because they see such different wayes of
administration of Ordinances.</p>

<p>5. There is no <i>relief when a Congregation is destitute of a
Minister, in point of Ordination</i>, but the succeeding Minister is
left to be examined and ordained by the people of the Congregation
that chose him. And so also when a Congregation becomes hereticall,
and in other such cases.</p>

<p>6. <i>If any of their Ministers preach out of their own Congregation,
he preacheth only as a gifted brother</i>; neither can he, (as we
conceive) according to their own Principles, administer the Sacraments
out of his own Congregation, or perform any other act of office.
Although we believe some of them do so, contrary to their own
principles herein.</p>

<p>9. <i>That the Presbyteriall Government is a Government that tends not
at all to the destruction of any, but for the good and edification of
all.</i> There are three chief ends of this Government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></span>
1. <i>To keep the Churches of Christ in unity amongst themselves.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>To keep them in purity and holinesse; it is</i> Christs <i>Fan,
to purge his floor; and his Beesom to sweep out of his house
every thing that offends</i>.</p>

<p>3. <i>To keep them in verity, it is</i> Christs Weeding-hook
<i>to weed out heresies</i>; and therefore King <i>James</i> (though
no great friend to this Government) would often say,
that it was <i>Malleus hæreticorum</i>, a Hammer to beat down
Heresies: And we find, that wheresoever it is set up in
strength, there the Churches are kept in unity, verity,
and purity; and that (which is very observeable) where
this Government hath once got possession, it hath for
ever after kept out Popery and all Popish Innovations.
The Prelatical Government with all its Lordships and
Revenues annexed, as it was managed of late years in
<i>England</i>, was an in-let to Popery, and it had <i>tantùmnon</i>
brought it in. But <i>wheresoever the</i> Presbyterian-Government
<i>is setled, there Popery, root and branch, is plucked
up and destroyed, and that without any hope of recovery</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Object.</i></div>

<p>But it will be objected, that notwithstanding all that
hath been said to render the Presbyterial Government
amiable and acceptable; yet there are two great Mountains
which do lye in the way which do hinder, and (as
some say) will for ever hinder people from submitting
unto it: The one is,</p>

<p>1. <i>Because it sets up a new officer in the</i> Church, <i>which
is a meer humane</i> Creature, having no authority from the
Word of God, nor was ever heard of in the Church of
Christ, till <i>Calvin</i>'s time, &amp; that is the LAY-ELDER.</p>

<p>2. <i>Because it requireth all, of all sorts, to come to the</i> Minister
<i>and these</i> Lay-Elders <i>to be examined, before they can
be admitted to the</i> Sacrament <i>of the</i> Lords Supper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Answer.</i></div>

<p>We cannot deny, but that these two objections are great
<i>Remora</i>'s to the Government, and do hinder the general receiving
of it, and therefore we shall be a little the larger in answering of
them.</p>

<p>For the first of them, we do here freely confesse, that if we were of
opinion, as some are, that the Ruling-Elder hath no foundation in the
Word of God, but is a meer humane Ordinance brought into the Church
only in a prudential way; we should heartily desire the utter
abolition of him: For we are not ignorant, that the Ruling Prelate was
brought into the Church upon the same account, for the avoiding of
Schism and Division, and afterwards proved the great Author and
Fomenter of Schism and Division. And if we should decline the Ruling
Prelate, and take in the Ruling Elder upon the same prudential
grounds, it were just with God to make him as mischievous to the
Church, as ever the Ruling Prelate was: And therefore let us consider
what may be said out of the Word of God, for the justification of this
so much <i>decryed Officer</i>: Yet first we cannot but take notice
that the name of <i>Lay-Elder</i> was affixed to this Officer by way
of reproach and scorn, by the adversaries of him, and that it ought
not to be continued. For though it be evident by Scripture<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_45" id="Ref_45" href="#Foot_45">[45]</a></span>,
that there is a great difference betwixt the Ministry usually called the Clergy,
and the people commonly called the Laity: yet its also as manifest,
that the Scripture<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_46" id="Ref_46" href="#Foot_46">[46]</a></span>
distinguisheth them not by the names of Clergy and
Laity; forasmuch as all Gods people are therein stiled the Lords
Clergy, or Inheritance, and the Lord is called their Inheritance. And
when persons are duly chosen from amongst the people to be Governours
in the Church, as such, they are no longer Lay-men, but Ecclesiastical
persons. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
therefore we profess a dislike of the name Lay-Elder,
and conceive they ought to be called either governours
in the Church, 1&nbsp;<i>Cor.</i> 12.23. or Ruling-Elders, as 1&nbsp;Tim.
5.17. not because their Office is to rule alone (for the
Teaching-Elder is a Ruler also, <i>Heb.</i> 13.17. 1&nbsp;<i>Thess.</i> 5.12.)
but because their Office is only to rule.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_47" id="Ref_47" href="#Foot_47">[47]</a></span> Now
concerning these Ruling-Elders, we confess, that they
are Officers somewhat new and strange to the Church
of <i>England</i>; yet not new nor strange to the Word of
God, nor to the Primitive times, nor (as all know) to
the <i>Reformed Churches</i>.</p>

<p>First, they are <i>not new nor strange to the Word of God,
neither in the Old Testament, nor in the New</i>. The Jews in
the <i>Old Testament</i>, had two sorts of <i>Elders</i>; <i>Elders of the
Priests</i>, and <i>Elders of the people</i>, suitable to our <i>teaching
and Ruling-Elders</i>; as appears, <i>Jer.</i> 19.1. And these <i>Elders</i>
of the people did sit and vote with the Priests and
Levites in all their Ecclesiasticall Consistories, and that
by divine appointment. That they were <i>constituent</i>
members of the great <i>Sanhedrim</i>, appears, 2&nbsp;<i>Chron.</i> 19.8.
where we reade, <i>That some of the chief of the Fathers were
joyned with the Priests, to judge in the matters if the Lord</i>.
And howsoever, many things among the Jews after the
captivity, did decline to disorder and confusion; yet we
finde even in the dayes of Christ, and his Apostles,
That the Elders of the people still sate and voyced in
the Councell with the Priests, according to the ancient
form, as is clear from <i>Matth.</i> 26.57, 59. <i>Matth.</i> 27.1, 12.
<i>Matth.</i> 16.21. <i>Matth.</i> 21.23. <i>Mar.</i> 14.43. <i>Luk.</i> 22.66. and
<i>Saravia</i> himself,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_48" id="Ref_48" href="#Foot_48">[48]</a></span>
who disputeth so much against <i>Ruling
Elders</i>, acknowledgeth thus much: <i>I finde indeed</i>, (saith
he) <i>Elders in the Assembly of the Priests of the old Synagogue,
which were not Priests; and their suffrages and authority</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">{32}</a></span>
<i>in all Judgments, were equal with the suffrages of the
Priests</i>. But he adds; That these Elders of the people
were civill Magistrates; which is a poor shift, directly
against many Scriptures, which contradistinguish these
<i>Elders</i> from the civil <i>Magistrate</i>; as appears; <i>Act.</i> 4.5.
<i>Judg.</i> 8.14. <i>Deut.</i> 5.23. <i>Josh.</i> 8.33. 2&nbsp;<i>King.</i> 10.15. <i>Ezra</i>
10.14. And though it were possible, that some of them
might be civill Magistrates, as some <i>Elders</i> amongst Us,
are Justices of the Peace: Yet they did not sit under
that capacity, in the Ecclesiastical <i>Sanhedrim</i>, but as Ecclesiastical
Elders.</p>

<p>And that the Jews also had <i>Elders of the people</i>, sitting
and voting in their inferiour Consistories, appears
(as we humbly conceive) from <i>Act.</i> 13.15. <i>Act.</i> 18.8,
17. <i>Mar.</i> 5.22. In which places, we read of the
Rulers of the Synagogue, who were neither Priests
nor Levites, and yet were Rulers in Church-matters,
and had power, together with the Priests, of casting
men out of the Synagogue, and of ordering Synagogue-worship,
<i>Joh.</i> 12.42. <i>Act.</i> 13.15.</p>

<p>Now this <i>Association</i> of the <i>Elders of the people, with
the Priest, in the Jewish Church-Government, was by divine
appointment</i>; for Moses first instituted it, and afterwards
<i>Jehosaphat</i> restored it, according as they were
directed by God, Num. 11.16. 2&nbsp;Chron. 19.8. And
it did belong to the <i>Jewish Church</i>, not as it was Jewish,
but as it was a Church, and therefore belongeth to the
Christian Church, as well as Jewish. <i>For whatsoever
agreeth to a Church, as a Church; agreeth to every Church.</i>
There was nothing Judaical or typical in this institution,
but it was founded upon the light of nature, and
right reason, which is alike in all ages.</p>

<p>But leaving the Old Testament, let us consider what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
may be said for the divine right of the <i>Ruling-Elder</i>, out
of the New Testament. For this purpose, we have already
produced three places, which we shall now
briefly open; and shew how the Ruling Elder is proved
out of them. The places are, 1&nbsp;<i>Cor.</i> 12.28. <i>Rom.</i> 12.7,
8. 1&nbsp;<i>Tim.</i> 5.17.</p>

<p>The first place is, 1&nbsp;<i>Cor.</i> 12.28. <i>And God hath set
some in the Church, first, Apostles; secondarily, Prophets;
thirdly, Teachers; After that, Miracles; then gifts
of healing, helps, governments, diversities of tongues</i>;
Where we have an enumeration of sundry Officers of
the Church; and amongst others, there are <i>Helps</i>, <i>Governments</i>.
By <i>Helps</i>, are meant <i>Deacons</i>; (as not only
our <i>Reformed</i> Divines, but <i>Chrysostome</i>, and <i>Estius</i>, and
others observe,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_49" id="Ref_49" href="#Foot_49">[49]</a></span>)
and by <i>Governments</i>, are meant the <i>Ruling-Elder</i>,
which that it may the better appear, we will
propound, and prove these six things.</p>

<p>1. That by <i>Governments</i>, are meant <i>men exercising
Government</i>, the <i>Abstract</i> put for the <i>Concrete</i>. The intent
of the <i>Apostle</i>, is not to speak of <i>offices</i> distinct from
<i>persons</i>, but of <i>persons exercising offices</i>. This appears
first, by the beginning of the verse, <i>God hath set some in
his Church</i>; this relates to persons, not unto offices. Secondly,
by the 29. and 30. verses, where the Apostle
speaks <i>concretively</i>, of those things which he had spoken
before <i>abstractively</i>. <i>Are all workers of miracles? have
all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues</i>, &amp;c? and
so by consequence, <i>Are all helpers, are all Governours?</i>
And therefore it is, that the Syriack instead of <i>helps, Governments</i>,
reads it <i>helpers, Governours</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_50" id="Ref_50" href="#Foot_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>2. That the <i>Governour</i> here meant, must needs be
a <i>Church-Governour</i>; for it is expresly said, that he is
seated in the Church, and therefore the civil Magistrate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
cannot be meant by this Governour, as some would
have it; partly, because this is quite besides the whole
intent and scope of the Chapter, treating meerly upon
<i>spirituall Church-matters</i>, not at all of secular civil matters;
and partly, because the Magistrate, as such, is not
placed by God in the <i>Church</i>, but in the <i>Common-Wealth</i>:
and partly, because the Apostle writes of such Governours,
that had at that time actual existence in the
Church; and neither then, nor divers hundred years
after, were there any <i>Christian Magistrates</i>.</p>

<p>3. That this <i>Church-Governour</i> is seated by God in his
Church; It is a <i>plant of Gods own planting</i>, and therefore
shall stand firme, maugre all opposition. For it is expresly
said, <i>God hath set some in his Church, first Apostles</i>,
&amp;c. <i>then helps, then Governments</i>.</p>

<p>4. That this Church-Governour thus seated by God
in his Churches, not only a <i>Church-member</i>, but a <i>Church-Officer</i>.
For though it be a question amongst the learned,
whether some of the persons here named, as the <i>workers
of miracles</i>, and those that had the <i>gift of healing, and
of tongues</i>, were seated by God, as officers in the Church,
and not rather, only as eminent members indued with
these eminent gifts; yet it is most certain, that whosoever
is seated by God in his Church, as a <i>Church Governour</i>,
must needs be a <i>Church officer</i>; for the nature of
the gift, doth necessarily imply an office. The Greek
word<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_51" id="Ref_51" href="#Foot_51">[51]</a></span>
for Governments, is a metaphor from <i>Pilots</i>, or
<i>Ship-masters</i>, governing their ships; (hence the Master of
a ship is called <span title="Kybernêtês">Κυβερνητης</span>, a Governour, <i>Jam.</i> 3.4.) and
it notes such officers, as sit at the stern of the vessel of the
Church, to govern and guide it in spirituals, according
to the will and mind of Christ, which is the direct office
of our <i>Ruling-Elder</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">{35}</a></span>
5. This Church-Governour thus seated by God in
his Church as a Church-officer, is an <i>ordinary and perpetuall
officer in his Church</i>. Indeed, here is mention
made of Officers extraordinary, as Apostles, Prophets;
and of gifts extraordinary, as the gift of miracles, healing,
and of tongues; but here is also mention made of
ordinary Officers, perpetually to abide, as <i>Teachers</i>,
<i>Helpers</i>, and the <i>Church-Governour, or Ruling-Elder</i>. And
that this Officer is ordinary and perpetual, appears from
the perpetual necessity of him in the Church; for a
Church without government, is as a ship without a Pilot,
as a Kingdom without a Magistrate, and a world
without a Sun.</p>

<p>6. That this Church-Governour thus seated by God
in his Church, as a perpetual Officer, is an officer <i>contradistinguished
in the Text from the</i> Apostles, Prophets,
Teachers, <i>and all other</i> Officers <i>in the</i> Church. This
appears; 1. By the Apostles manner of expressing
these officers in an <i>enumerative</i> form; <i>First, Apostles;
Secondarily, Prophets; Thirdly, Teachers; After that,
miracles, then gifts of healing</i>, &amp;c. 2. By the recapitulation,
vers. 29, 30. <i>Are all Apostles? Are all Prophets?
Are all Teachers? Are all workers of miracles?</i> &amp;c. 3. By
the scope of the whole Chapter, which is to set down
different gifts and offices in different subjects; It is said,
ver. 8, 9. <i>To one is given by the Spirit, the word of wisdom; to
another the word of knowledg by the same Spirit; to another,
faith</i>, &amp;c. And for this purpose, the Apostle draweth
a simile from the members of mans body: As there are
different members in mans body, and every member
hath its different office, and every member stands in
need one of another; the Eye cannot say to the Hand,
I have no need of thee; nor again, the head to the foot,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>
I have no need of thee, &amp;c. So it is in the Church ministerial,
which is the body of Christ. God hath set different
Officers in his Church; some ordinary and perpetual;
some extraordinary and temporary: And these
different Officers have different Offices, some to teach,
others to distribute to the poor Saints, others to govern.
Are all Teachers? are all Deacons? are all
Church-Governours? and these have all need one of
another. The Teacher cannot say to the Deacon, I have
no need of thee; nor to the Church Governour, I have
no need of thee: But if all these Offices were in the Pastor
alone, and only, then might he truly say to the Deacon
and Ruling-Elder, I have no need of thee. But now
God hath so set the members in his body which is his
Church, that every member stands in need one of anothers
help and support.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Object.</i></div>

<p>If it be objected, that the Apostles had all these offices
and gifts here mentioned, eminently seated in them, for
they were Prophets, Teachers, Workers of Miracles;
and therefore why may not all these be understood of
one and the same person?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></div>

<p>Though it be true, that the Apostles had eminently all
these; yet it is as true, that there are many here named,
which had but one of these gifts formally seated in
them: And it is also apparent, that some of the persons
here named were distinct Officers in the Church, as the
Prophet, and the Teacher. Though the Apostles were
Prophets and Teachers, yet the Prophet &amp; the Teacher
were Officers distinct from the Apostles; and by a
parity of Reason, so were the Governors from the Apostle,
Prophet, and Teacher; the scope of the Apostle
being (as hath been said) to set out distinct Offices in distinct
Officers: are all Apostles? are all Prophets? are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
all Teachers? The sum of what we have said from this
Scripture, then, is this, <i>That God hath seated some men in
his Church which have a gift and office to govern, which are
neither Apostles, Prophets, Teachers, nor Pastors; and therefore
they are Ruling-Elders</i>, which is the Officer which
we are enquiring after.</p>

<p>Now this Interpretation which we have given, is not
only the interpretation of Reformed Divines, both <i>Lutherane</i>
and <i>Calvinists</i>, but of the ancient Fathers, and
even the Papists themselves, as appears by the quotations
in the Margent.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_52" id="Ref_52" href="#Foot_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>The second text is, <i>Rom.</i> 12.6, 7, 8. <i>Having then gifts
differing according to the grace given, whether Prophesie, let
us prophesie according to the proportion of Faith; or Ministry,
let us wait on our Ministring; or he that teacheth, on
teaching; or he that exhorteth, on exhortation. He that giveth,
let him do it with simplicity. He that ruleth, with diligence.
He that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.</i> In which
words, we have a perfect enumeration of all the ordinary
Offices of the Church. These offices are reduced,
first, to two general heads, <i>Prophesie</i> and <i>Ministry</i>, and
are therefore set down in the <i>Abstract</i>. By <i>Prophesie</i> is
meant the faculty of right understanding, interpreting,
and expounding the Scriptures. Ministry comprehends
all other employments in the Church. Then these generals
are subdivided into the special offices contained
under them, and are therefore put down in the concrete.
Under <i>Prophesie</i> are contained, 1. <i>He that teacheth</i>, that
is, the Doctor or Teacher. 2. <i>He that exhorteth, i. e.</i> the
Pastor. Under <i>Ministry</i> are comprized, 1. <i>He that giveth</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span>
that is, the Deacon. 2. <i>He that ruleth</i>, that is, the
Ruling Elder. 3. <i>He that sheweth mercy</i>, which <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_53" id="Ref_53" href="#Foot_53">[53]</a></span>Office
pertained unto them, who in those days had care of the
sick: So that in these words, we have the <i>Ruling-Elder</i>
plainly set down, and <i>contra</i>-distinguished from the
<i>teaching</i> and <i>exhorting Elder</i> (as appears by the distributive
particles, <span title="eite ho didaskôn, eite ho parakalôn">ειτε ὁ διδασκων,
ειτε ὁ παρακαλων</span>, <i>Whether he that
teacheth</i>; <i>Whether he that exhorteth</i>; <i>Whether he that ruleth</i>,
&amp;c.) And here likewise we have the divine institution
of the Ruling-Elder, for so the words hold forth.
<i>Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is
given unto us</i>; and thus also in the third verse, <i>according
as God hath dealt to every man</i>, &amp;c. This officer is the gift
of Gods free grace to the Church, for the good of it.</p>

<p>Against this Exposition of the Text, it is objected by
those that oppose the divine right of the Ruling-Elder,
that the Apostle speaks, in these words, not of several
offices in several persons, but of severall Gifts in one
and the same person; for he saith, <i>having then Gifts differing
according</i>, &amp;c. But we answer:</p>

<p>1. That the word <i>Gift</i> is often in Scripture taken for
<i>Office</i>; as <i>Eph.</i> 4.8, 11. <i>When he ascended on high, he led
captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men</i>; and v. 11. <i>He
sheweth what these gifts were, some to be Apostles, some
Evangelists</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>2. That the Apostle in the <i>Protasis</i> speaks not of severall
Gifts, but of severall Offices, and these not in the
same, but in several members, <i>v.</i> 4. <i>As we have many
members in one body, and all members have not the same
office.</i> And therefore the <i>apodosis</i> must also be understood
not only of <i>severall gifts</i>, but of <i>severall Offices</i>,
and these in <i>several subjects</i>. And this further appears by
the very similitude which the Apostle here useth, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></span>
is the same he used, 1&nbsp;<i>Cor.</i> 12. from the body natural,
wherein there are many distinct members, and every
member hath its distinct Office; and so it is in the
Church of Christ.</p>

<p>3. These gifts here mentioned, and the waiting upon
them, do necessarily imply an Office in whomsoever
they are; and therefore they are set down emphatically
with an Article, <span title="eite ho didaskôn ho proistamenos">ειτε ὁ
διδασκων ὁ προισταμενος</span>. He that hath
the gift of teaching, and exhorting, and ruling, and waiteth
upon this gift, what is he but a Teacher, Pastor, and
Ruling-Elder? And this must either be granted, or else
we must open a door for all members of the Church,
even women, not only to preach and teach, but to rule
also, and to wait upon preaching and ruling: This truth
is so clear, as that the Papists themselves being convinced
of it, do say<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_54" id="Ref_54" href="#Foot_54">[54]</a></span>
upon this text, that the Apostle here
first speaks of gifts in general; and secondly, applyeth
these gifts to Ecclesiastical Officers, v. 6. and afterwards
directs his exhortation to all Christians in general.</p>

<p>The third text for the divine right of the <i>Ruling-Elder</i>,
is, 1&nbsp;<i>Tim.</i> 5.17. <i>Let the Elders that rule well be counted
worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the
Word and Doctrine.</i> For the understanding of which
words, we will lay down this rule, That every text of
Scripture is to be interpreted according to the literall
and grammatical construction; unless it be contrary to
the analogie of Faith, or the rule of Life, or the
circumstances of the Text: otherwise, we shall make a nose of
wax of the Scriptures, and draw <i>quidlibet ex quolibet</i>.
Now according to the <i>Grammatical construction</i>, here
are plainly held forth <i>two sorts of Elders</i>; the one, <i>onely
ruling</i>; and the other, <i>also labouring in Word and Doctrine</i>.
Give us leave to give you the true analysis of the words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
1. Here is a <i>Genus</i>, a general, and that is <i>Elders</i>.</p>

<p>2. Two distinct species, or kinds of Elders, <i>Those that
rule well</i>, and <i>those that labour in word and doctrine</i>; as
Pastor and Doctor.</p>

<p>3. Here we have two participles, expressing these two
kinds of Elders, <i>Ruling</i>, <i>Labouring</i>, the first do only rule,
the second do also labour in Word and Doctrine.</p>

<p>4. Here are two distinct Articles, distinctly annexed
to these two participles, <span title="hoi proestôtes, hoi kopiôntes">ὁι
προεστωτες, ὁι κοπιωντες</span>. They that rule, They that labour.</p>

<p>5. Here is an <i>eminent discretive particle</i>, set betwixt
these two kinds of Elders; these two participles, these
two Articles evidently distinguishing one from the other,
<i>viz.</i> <span title="malista">μαλιστα</span> <i>especially they that labour</i>, &amp;c. And
wheresoever this word <span title="malista">μαλιστα</span> is used in the New Testament,
it is used, to distinguish thing from thing, or person
from person; as <i>Gal.</i> 6.10. <i>Phil.</i> 4.22. 1&nbsp;<i>Tim.</i> 5.8.
1&nbsp;<i>Tim.</i> 4.10. <i>Tit.</i> 1.10. 2&nbsp;<i>Tim.</i> 4.13. 2&nbsp;<i>Pet.</i> 2.20. <i>Act.</i>
20.38. In all which places, the word [<i>especially</i>] is used
as a discretive particle, to distinguish one thing from another,
or one person from another; and therefore being
applyed here to persons, must necessarily distinguish
person from person, officer from officer. It is absurd
to say, (saith Dr. <i>Whitaker</i>,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_55" id="Ref_55" href="#Foot_55">[55]</a></span>)
that this text is to be understood
of one and the same Elder. If a man should
say, <i>All the Students in the University are worthy of double
honour, especially, They that are Professors of Divinity; He
must necessarily understand it of two sorts of Students</i>. Or if
a man should say, <i>All Gentlemen that do service for the
Kingdom in their Counties, are worthy of double honour, especially
they that do service in the Parliament; this must needs
be understood of different persons</i>. We are not ignorant,
that Archbishop <i>Whitgift</i>, Bishop <i>King</i>, Bishop <i>Bilson</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">{41}</a></span>
Bishop <i>Downame</i>, &amp; others, labour to fasten divers other
interpretations upon these words, which would be
over-tedious here to rehearse. Only thus much we crave
leave to say, which we desire may be seriously weighed;
That all other senses that are given of these words,
are either such as are disagreeing from the literall and
Grammatical construction, or such as fall into one of
these two absurdities, either to maintain a <i>non-preaching
Ministry</i>, or a <i>lazy-preaching Ministry</i> to deserve double
honour. Archbishop <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_56" id="Ref_56" href="#Foot_56">[56]</a></span><i>Whitgift</i>
by the Elder that rules
well, understands a Reader that is not a Preacher. <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_57" id="Ref_57" href="#Foot_57">[57]</a></span>Dr.
<i>King</i>, a Bishop ruling, and not preaching; which is to
say, that a non-preaching Minister deserves double honour.
Dr. <i>Bilson</i> <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_58" id="Ref_58" href="#Foot_58">[58]</a></span>saith,
that the words are to be understood
of two sorts of Elders, and that the meaning is,
That the Elder that rules well, and preacheth, is worthy
of double honour, especially they that labour, that is,
<i>that preach abundantly</i>, that do <span title="kopian">κοπιαν</span>, labour as a
Waterman at his Oar; which is as much as if he had said, that
a <i>lazy Minister</i>, or a <i>seldome-preaching Minister, deserves
double honour</i>. For all Preachers are in Scripture required
<span title="kopian">κοπιαν</span>, <i>to labour abundantly, 1&nbsp;Thess.</i> 5.11. <i>1&nbsp;Cor.</i> 3.8.
where the same word is used that is here expressed. If
the Apostle had meant to have distinguished them by
their extraordinary labour, he would rather have said,
<span title="mochthountes">μοχθουντες</span>, then <span title="kopiôntes">κοπιωντες</span>,
for other-where he useth <span title="mochthos">μοχθος</span>,
as a degree of painful labour, above <span title="kopos">κοπος</span>, which is put
for common labour, <i>Rom.</i> 16.12.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_59" id="Ref_59" href="#Foot_59">[59]</a></span>
Dr. <i>Downame</i> and others,
interpret the words of one and the same Elder,
thus, The Elders that rule well, are worthy of double
honour, especially they that labour; that is, (say they)
<i>especially they labouring, or especially because they labour</i>.
And so they make their labouring, to be the chief cause
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span>
of their double honour. But this interpretation is against
the literal meaning, for the Greek is not <span title="ei kopiôsin">ει κοπιωσιν</span>,
<i>if they labour</i>, but <span title="malista hoi kopiôntes">μαλιστα ὁι κοπιωντες</span>,
<i>especially they that labour</i>. Here is a participle with an Article, and a <i>discretive
particle</i>, which can never be rightly and literally translated
<i>causatively</i>. And therefore we conclude, together with our
Reformed Divines<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_60" id="Ref_60" href="#Foot_60">[60]</a></span>,
that this text according to the
proper and Grammatical construction of it, doth hold
forth unto all unprejudiced Christians, a Ruling Elder,
distinct from a teaching Elder, which is the thing we
undertook to prove.</p>

<p>Besides these three Scriptures thus expounded, we
shall briefly offer one more; and that is, Matth. 18.17.
where the offended Brother is bid <i>to tell the Church</i>,
&amp;c. In which words, the whole power of excommunication
is placed by Christ in the <i>Church</i>. The great
question is, what is meant by Church? Here we take
for granted: 1. That by Church, is not meant the civil
Magistrate, as <i>Erastus</i> fondly imagineth; for this is
utterly contrary to the purpose of Christ, and the aym
of that discipline here recommended to be used, which
is the <i>gaining of our brother unto repentance</i>; whereas the
aym of the civil Magistrate, is not the spiritual good
properly and formally of the offender, but the publique
good of the Common-Wealth. And besides, it is a language
unknown in Scripture, to call the Magistrate the
Church; and it is an exposition purposely invented, to
overthrow all Ecclesiastical government.</p>

<p>2. That by Church, is meant <i>primarily and especially</i>
the particular Congregation; we do not say <i>onely</i>, but
firstly and especially. Hence we argue; If the power
of Excommunication be placed in the particular
Church, then either in the Minister alone, or in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">{43}</a></span>
Minister and whole Congregation, or in the Minister
and Elders chosen by the congregation.</p>

<p>But not in the Minister alone, who being but one man, can no more be
called a Church, then one man can be called many, or a member called a
body. For one person cannot be called a Church, (saith
<i>Bellarmine</i> himself<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_61" id="Ref_61" href="#Foot_61">[61]</a></span>,)
seeing the Church is the people and
Kingdome of God. It is certain, that the Church here spoken of, is a
certain number met together; for it is said, <i>Where two or three are
gathered together</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Nor in the Minister and whole Congregation; for God who is the God of
order, not of confusion, hath never committed the exercise of
Ecclesiasticall jurisdiction, to a promiscuous multitude; the
Scripture<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_62" id="Ref_62" href="#Foot_62">[62]</a></span>
divides a Congregation into Rulers and Saints, into
Governours, and governed; and if all be Governours, who will be left
to be governed? And besides, if the collective body of a Church be the
Governours, then women and servants must govern as well as others.</p>

<p>And therefore we conclude, that by Church, must needs be meant, the
Minister and Ruling-Elders, which are the Officers we are enquiring
after.</p>

<p>And this is no new interpretation, but agreed unto
by ancient and modern Writers. <i>Chrysostome</i> saith<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_63" id="Ref_63" href="#Foot_63">[63]</a></span>, by
Church, is meant the <span title="proestôtes">προεστωτες</span>, <i>the Rulers of the Church</i>,
Camer.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_64" id="Ref_64" href="#Foot_64">[64]</a></span>
<i>the Colledg of Presbyters</i>; others, the <i>Ecclesiacall
Senate</i>. These are called a Church, for four Reasons:</p>

<p>1. Because it is usual in the Old Testament, (to which our Saviour
here alludeth, as appears by the words Publican and Heathen,) to call
the Assembly of Princes and Elders a Church, Numb. 35.12, 24, 25. with
Deut. 1.16. 1&nbsp;Chron. 13.2, 3. with 28.1, 2. &amp; 29.1, 6. Deut. 31.28,
30. 1&nbsp;King. 8.1, 2, 55. Num. 5.2. compared with Levit. 13.15.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">{44}</a></span>
2. Because they manage Church affaires in the name of Christ, and of
the Church, and are servants of the Church, as well as of Christ.</p>

<p>3. Because they are, as it were, the eyes and ears of the Church; and
therefore as the body is said to see or hear, when as the eyes and
eares alone do see and hear; so the Church is said to see, hear, and
act, that which this <i>Senate Ecclesiasticall</i> doth see, hear, and act.</p>

<p>4. Because they represent the Church; and it is a common form of
speech, to give the name of that which is represented, to that which
represents it; as we say, that to be done by the whole Kingdome, which
is done by a full and free Parliament. Hence we might further argue:</p>

<p><i>If the Colledge of Presbyters represent the Church, then it must be
made up of Ruling-Elders, as well as Ministers.</i> For Ministers
alone cannot represent the Church; the Church consisting not of
Ministers alone, but of Ministers and people, who are part of the
Church as well as Ministers, and are so called, <i>Act.</i> 15.3, 4.</p>

<p>This is all we shall say, for the Scriptural part.</p>

<p>As for the <i>Primitive times of the Church</i>, we should have
wholly waved the mention of any thing about them,
were it not for the base calumnies &amp; reproaches which
the Prelatical party cast upon the Ruling-Elder, in saying,
That it is <i>the new fangled device of Calvin at Geneva</i>;
and never known in the Church of Christ before his
dayes. There is a Bishop <span
class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Episcopacy by Divine right.<span
class="hidev">|</span></span>that <i>makes offer to forfeit his life
to justice, and his reputation to shame, if any man living can
shew, that ever there was a Ruling-Elder in the Christian
world, till</i> Farell <i>and</i> Viret <i>first created them</i>. But he hath
been abundantly answered by <i>Smectymnuus</i>, insomuch,
that whereas in his Episcopacy by Divine Right, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">{45}</a></span>
boldly averreth, that the name of the Elders of the
Church, comprehendeth none but preachers, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_65" id="Ref_65" href="#Foot_65">[65]</a></span>and
that therefore none but they may be called <i>Seniores Ecclesiæ,
Elders of the Church</i>; though some others haply
may have the title of <i>Seniores populi, Elders of the people</i>,
because of their <i>civill Authority</i>. Yet notwithstanding
afterward, the same Bishop in his <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_66" id="Ref_66" href="#Foot_66">[66]</a></span>reply to <i>Smectymnuus</i>
acknowledgeth, that besides <i>Pastors and Doctors</i>,
and besides <i>Magistrates and Elders of the City</i>, there are to
be found in Antiquity, <i>Seniores Ecclesiastici, Ecclesiastical
Elders</i> also; only he alledgeth, they were but as our
Church-Wardens, or rather, as our vestry-men; whereas
in truth, <i>They were Judges in Ecclesiasticall controversies</i>,
and did assist the Pastor in ruling and governing
the Church; witnesse that famous place in <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_67" id="Ref_67" href="#Foot_67">[67]</a></span><i>Ambrose</i>,
which testifies, <i>that both in the Jewish and in the Christian
Church, there were these Ecclesiasticall Rulers</i>. This is
also the judgment of <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_68" id="Ref_68" href="#Foot_68">[68]</a></span><i>Tertullian</i>,
<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_69" id="Ref_69" href="#Foot_69">[69]</a></span><i>Origen</i>,
<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_70" id="Ref_70" href="#Foot_70">[70]</a></span><i>Basil</i>,
<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_71" id="Ref_71" href="#Foot_71">[71]</a></span><i>Optatus</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">{46}</a></span>
<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_72" id="Ref_72" href="#Foot_72">[72]</a></span><i>Hierome</i>,
<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_73" id="Ref_73" href="#Foot_73">[73]</a></span><i>Augustine</i>,
<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_74" id="Ref_74" href="#Foot_74">[74]</a></span><i>Gregory</i>
the great, and divers others cited by <i>Justellus</i> in his Annotations in
<i>Can. Eccl. Affricanæ</i>, and by <i>Voetius</i>, and by <i>Smectymnuus</i>,
and by the Author of the <i>Assertion of the Scotch
Discipline</i>, some of which are rehearsed in the Margent.
We will conclude this Discourse, with the confession
of Archbishop <i>Whitgift</i>, a great Writer against the Presbyterial-Government;
<i>I know (saith he) that in the Primitive
Church, they had in every Church Seniors, to whom
the Government of the Church was committed, but that was
before there was any Christian Prince or Magistrate</i>.</p>

<p>And therefore, let not our respective Congregations suffer themselves
to be abused any longer with a false
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">{47}</a></span>
belief, that the <i>Ruling-Elder</i> is a new device, and an <i>Officer</i>
never known in the <i>Church of God</i>, nor <i>Word of God</i>.
For we have sufficiently (as we conceive) proved it to
be warranted by the Word, and to have been of use in
the purer times of the Church.</p>

<p>Three things we shall desire to adde, as a conclusion of this
discourse.</p>

<p>1. <i>That there are prints of the Ruling-Elder remaining
amongst us even at this day</i>; for as the <i>Overseers</i> of every
Parish, have a <i>resemblance of the Deacon</i>; so the <i>Church-warden</i>
hath some <i>foot-steps</i> of our <i>Ruling-Elder</i>; though
we must needs confess, that this <i>Office hath been much
abused</i>; and we could desire it might be laid aside, and
the true <i>Scripture-Ruling-Elder</i> set up in his place.</p>

<p>2. That the Prelatical Divines, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_75" id="Ref_75" href="#Foot_75">[75]</a></span>which are such great
adversaries to the <i>Ruling-Elder</i>, do yet notwithstanding,
hold and prove, that men of abilities which are
not Ministers, are to be admitted into <i>Generall Councels</i>;
because that in the Synod of <i>Jerusalem</i>, not only the
<i>Apostles</i>, but <i>Elders</i> and <i>Brethren</i> did sit and vote,
because this was practised in the <i>Old Testament</i>; and because
that this was practised in the Councels held afterwards
in the Church of Christ, as appears out of
<i>Eusebius</i>, <i>Sozomen</i> and <i>Theodoret</i>, and by the
subscriptions of those Councels done by men, not Ministers,
as well as others.</p>

<p>Hence we might argue;</p>

<p><i>If other men, besides Ministers, are by Gods word, even in the
judgment of the Prelaticall Divines, to be admitted into the greatest
Assemblies, and Councels of the Church, much more are they by the same
right to be admitted into particular Congregations, to sit and vote
with the Minister in the Government of the Church.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span>
3. Adde thirdly, that even in the Bishops days, for
these many hundred years, there have been <i>Ruling-Elders</i>
in the Church; for the <i>Chancellours</i>, <i>Commissaries</i>,
<i>Officials</i>, and such others, were all of them <i>Governours
of the Church</i>, and had the <i>power of suspension and excommunication</i>;
and yet were few of them, if any, <i>Ministers
of the Word</i>: And it seems to us, to be a great <i>curse of
God</i>, that lyeth upon mens spirits, that could willingly
submit to <i>Chancellours</i> &amp; <i>Commissaries</i>, who did nothing
else but <i>pick their purses, and tyrannize over their bodies
and estates</i>, and yet will not submit unto the <i>Ruling-Elder</i>
now established, who <i>seeks no other interest, but the
interest of Christ, and medleth not with mens bodies or
estates, and desireth nothing but to be helpfull to the Ministers
of Christ, to keep their Congregations in unity, piety,
and verity</i>. This is all we shall say, in answer to the first
Objection.</p>

<p>The second grand Objection against the
<i>Presbyteriall-Government</i>, is, that it requires all, of all
sorts, to come to the <i>Minister</i> and <i>Elders</i> to be
examined, before they can be admitted to the Sacrament of the Lords
Supper, which is (as some ignorantly say) to bring in auricular
confession again into the Church, to bring the people of God into a
spirituall slavery and bondage unto the Eldership, and which is an
usurpation more then prelaticall, and a tyrannicall domineering over
mens consciences, and hath no footing in the Word; for the Scripture
saith, <i>Let a man examine himself, and so let him eate</i>, &amp;c. It
is not said, <i>Let him first be examined by the Ministers and
Elders</i>: the Scripture addes, <i>He that eats and drinks
unworthily, eats and drinks damnation to himself</i>, not to the
Eldership. And why then must a man submit himself unto the examination
of the Eldership?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">{49}</a></span>
and how come the Eldership to be guilty of another
mans unworthy receiving? It is further added
by some, that for their parts, they will willingly come
before the Minister, and submit to his examination, but
they will rather for ever be without the Sacrament,
then submit to come before the <i>Lay-Elder</i>, for whom,
they see no warrant in the Word of God: Others say,
that they will freely yield that the <i>younger sort</i>, that never
have received the Sacrament, should present themselves
to the <i>Eldership</i> to be catechized, and instructed,
and fitted for the Sacrament; but they will never yield,
that old men and women, that heretofore have divers
times received, should now in their old age be required
to come, to be examined not only by their Minister, but
by the Elders also, who oftentimes are very unfit for
that Office: Others adde, that though some Ministers
rigidly keep all from the Sacrament, that will not come
before the Elderships; yet there are others, that are
<i>Presbyterians, and have Elders chosen, that act without
them</i>, and will receive us to the Sacrament without comming
before them. These, and such like Objections,
are brought against this way of Examination, that is so
happily begun amongst us. Now that we might satisfie
these Objections, and make good our practice out
of the Word of God, we shall briefly do these four
things.</p>

<p>1. <i>We will declare what our practice is in this particular.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>We will prove, that he that will come to the Sacrament, ought
first to submit to examination.</i></p>

<p>3. <i>That the power to examine, belongs not to the Minister alone,
nor to the Minister with the whole Church, but to the Minister and
Elders.</i></p>

<p>4. <i>We will answer the Objections, that are brought against this way
of examination by the Minister and Elders.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
For the first of these, we say;</p>

<p>First, That the <i>Presbyterial-Government</i>, doth not precisely &amp;
peremptorily require of those that come to the Sacrament, that they
should first be examined by questions and answers, but if any man or
woman shall make a good profession of their Faith in a continued
discourse, without being <i>asked any questions</i>, it will be as well
accepted, as if they were examined by particular questions.</p>

<p>Secondly, that this <i>examination</i> or <i>profession</i> is not
required every time men come to <i>the Sacrament</i>, but only
<i>at their first admission</i>.</p>

<p>3. That he that is duly admitted into compleat <i>Church-fellowship in
the Presbyterian-way</i>, is not only by vertue of his first
admission, freed from all <i>after-examination</i> (unless it be when
he falls into any scandalous transgression) in the Congregation, to
which he belongs; but he is inabled by a certificate from his
Eldership, to receive the Sacrament in any Church of the Christian
world of the same constitution, without any new examination.</p>

<p>Fourthly, that the reason why ancient men and women, and others, that
have formerly under the <i>Prelatical Government</i> been admitted to the
Sacrament, are now required to submit to examination, before they can
be again admitted, doth not <i>proceed from the nature of the
Presbyterian Government, but chiefly from the neglect of the
Prelaticall</i>: For it is so evident, that it cannot be denyed, that
under the former Government, men and women of all sorts, though never
so ignorant or scandalous, were in most places admitted promiscuously
to the Sacrament without any examination. Now this grievous disorder,
and great iniquity in the Prelatical Government, is the principal
cause of all the trouble we meet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>
withal in ours; and we desire earnestly our people to
distinguish with us, between a Church deformed, and
reformed. If the Churches of God in <i>England</i> were
once so reformed, that there were an orderly admission,
by examination or profession, unto the Lords Table by
the Eldership; then we should require none to come to
examination, but such only as never yet communicated,
whom we would endeavour to train up in knowledge,
by catechizing, and by Gods blessing, make fit in time,
to be partakers of such heavenly mysteries. But now
because our Churches, through want of Discipline, are
deformed, &amp; all sorts have been sinfully admitted without
tryal: Hence it is, that we are forced, even out of
tender regard to the souls of old people, and to free our
selves from the guilt of their sins, and out of desire to
keep the Sacrament from prophanation, to examine even
aged people (many of whom we find very ignorant) and
all sorts as have been formerly admitted (many of
whom we find to be very unworthy) that so we may
bring our Congregations into Gospel-order. This we
say, <i>we are absolutely necessitated to do upon conscientious
grounds, which we cannot recede from, though we find it very
prejudiciall to our selves, and to our Government</i>. But in the
mean time, we desire our respective Congregations to
consider, that this is a necessity, that the iniquity of former
times hath brought upon us; and that it doth not
flow from the principles of our Government, but only
from the negligence and sinfulness of Prelatical Governours.</p>

<p>The second thing propounded, is to prove, that he that will come to
the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, ought first to submit to
examination, and tryal, as it hath been formerly explained: For this
purpose, we will lay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span>
down these three Propositions.</p>

<p>1. <i>It is the Will of Jesus Christ, that no grosly ignorant, or
scandalous person should come to the Sacrament.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>That it is the Will of Jesus Christ, that those who are grosly
ignorant, or scandalous, should be kept from the Sacrament (if they
offer to come) by the Officers of the Church.</i></p>

<p>3. <i>That it is the Will of Jesus Christ, that Church-Governours have
some sufficient way to find out who are such ignorant and scandalous
persons, that they may be kept away.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">1. Proposition.</div>

<p><i>That it is the Will of Jesus Christ, that no grosly ignorant, or
scandalous person, should come to the Sacrament.</i></p>

<p>1. No <i>grosly ignorant person</i>, because the Scripture saith,
<i>that a man must first examine himself, and so eat of that bread,
and drink of that cup</i>; and it likewise saith, that he that will
come to the Sacrament must be one that <i>discerneth the Lords
body</i>; otherwise he <i>eats and drinks damnation to himself</i>;
and it adds, that we are to do this <i>in remembrance of Christ</i>,
and thereby to <i>shew forth the Lords death till he come</i>. And
therefore a man that is grosly ignorant, and is not able to examine
himself, nor to discern the Lords body, nor to remember Christ; nor
understands what it is to shew forth the Lords death, ought not to
come to the Sacrament, no more then a baptized Infant, who is
therefore not to partake of this Ordinance, because of his want of
knowledge.</p>

<p>2. No <i>scandalous person</i>: This is evidenced from the words of
the Apostle, <i>Let a man examine himself, &amp; so let him eat</i>, &amp;c.
from which words we gather two things:</p>

<p>1. That he that would come to the Sacrament, <i>must examine
himself</i>; which examination ought to be according to the nature of
the Ordinance of the Lords Supper, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p>1. In general; whether he be worthy to come, or no; (not with a
<i>worthinesse of merit</i>, but of <i>Evangelical suitablenesse</i>.)</p>

<p>2. In particular:</p>

<p>1. Whether he have <i>true Faith in Christ</i>, without which,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">{53}</a></span>
he cannot worthily eat this bread, and drink this cup.</p>

<p>2. Whether he <i>truly repent for sin, and from sin</i>. For he that
comes in any sin unrepented of, comes unclean, and so pollutes the
ordinance.</p>

<p>3. Whether he be <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_76" id="Ref_76" href="#Foot_76">[76]</a></span><i>truly
united by love to Jesus Christ, and his
members</i>; without which, he cannot enjoy communion with them in
that ordinance.</p>

<p>2. That he who upon due examination, can find none of these
qualifications, should not presume to come, which appears:</p>

<p>1. By the Apostolical command, <i>But let a man examine himself, and
so let him eat; so</i>, and <i>not otherwise</i>.</p>

<p>2. By the sin which he commits, in <i>being guilty of the body and
blood of Christ</i>, vers. 27.</p>

<p>3. By the <i>Danger</i> he incurres to himself, in <i>eating and
drinking his own damnation</i>, vers. 29.</p>

<p>2. From the nature of the Sacrament.</p>

<p>1. It is the <i>table of the Lord, and the Lords Supper</i>; and
consequently the friends, and not the enemies of Christ, are thereto
invited.</p>

<p>2. It is an ordinance, wherein we publiquely profess communion with
Christ and his mystical body, &amp; if he that comes, be by sin disjoyned
from Christ, he is guilty of a <i>sacrilegious lye against him and his
Church</i>, whilest he professeth himself to be a <i>friend</i>, and
is <i>really an enemy</i>.</p>

<p>3. It is (according to the nature of all Sacraments,) <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_77" id="Ref_77" href="#Foot_77">[77]</a></span>a sealing
Ordinance, as is intimated in those remarkable sacramental phrases,
<i>This is my body, this is my blood</i>, denoting not only a bare
sacramental signification, but also a spiritual obsignation and
exhibition of Christs body and blood, to a worthy receiver. Now a seal
supposeth a writing to which it is annext, or else it is a meer
nullity; and certainly Christ never intended to have his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>
Seal put to a blank or counterfeit writing.</p>

<p>4. It is an ordinance appointed for the nourishment of those who are
spiritually alive, Christs body &amp; blood being therein conveyed under
the Elements of bread &amp; wine; which they only can eat and drink, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_78" id="Ref_78" href="#Foot_78">[78]</a></span>who
are alive by Faith, and not they that are dead in trespasses &amp; sins.</p>

<p>5. It is the <i>New Testament in the blood of Christ</i>, that is,
<i>a confirmation of the New Testament</i>, and of all the promises
and priviledges thereof in the blood of Christ, which belong not at
all to wicked men, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_79" id="Ref_79" href="#Foot_79">[79]</a></span><i>Godlinesse
having the promises of this life, and
that which is to come</i>.</p>

<p>By all which it appears, that it is the Will of Christ, that no
scandalous person should come to the Lords table.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2. Proposition.</div>

<p><i>That it is the Will of Jesus Christ, that those who are grosly
ignorant, or scandalously wicked, should be kept from the Sacrament,
(if they offer to come,) by Church-Officers.</i></p>

<p>And this is evident:</p>

<p>1. <i>From the power given to Church-Officers for that purpose.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>From the evill consequents that will otherwise ensue.</i></p>

<p>1. That such a power is given to Church-Officers, appears,</p>

<p>Not onely</p>

<p>From the proportionable practice of Church-Officers under the Old
Testament, who kept the charge of the holy things of God, and were
appointed <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_80" id="Ref_80" href="#Foot_80">[80]</a></span>to
see that none who were unclean in any thing, or
uncircumcised in flesh, or in heart, should enter into the Temple, to
partake of the holy things of God, and <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_81" id="Ref_81" href="#Foot_81">[81]</a></span>had
a power to put
difference between holy and unholy, which power was not meerly
<i>doctrinall</i> or <i>declarative</i>, <i>but decisive, binding</i>, and
<i>juridicall</i>, so far, as that according to their sentence, men were
to be admitted, or excluded. That there was a power in the Old
Testament to keep men from the Sacrament of the Passeover, for morall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">{55}</a></span>
wickednesse, <i>vide Aarons</i> rod blossoming, lib. 1. cap. 9, 10, &amp;c.</p>

<p>But also,</p>

<p>From that power of Government, and <i>key of Discipline</i>, committed
by Jesus Christ, to Church-Officers, under the New Testament. For
Christ hath given to them the keys of the Kingdom of heaven, which
imply not only a key of doctrine, but of discipline, and that both to
<i>keep out such as Christ would not have received in, and to shut out
such as Christ would not have to continue in</i>; The use of a key
being for both these purposes. For shutting out those that should not
be continued in, as is granted on all hands from divers Scriptures<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_82" id="Ref_82" href="#Foot_82">[82]</a></span>.
And consequently, for <i>keeping out those that should not be received
in</i>, there being the same reason of both. <i>For to what purpose
should such be received in, as are by Christs command immediately to
be cast out again.</i></p>

<p>2. That divers ill consequences will otherwise ensue, if grosly
ignorant, and scandalous persons be not kept away, is plain.</p>

<p>1. <i>Church-Governours should be very unfaithfull Stewards of the
Mysteries of Christ, and perverters of his Ordinance.</i> If a Steward
to whom his Lord hath committed his goods to be carefully distributed,
to such as are honest, faithfull, and diligent in his field or
Vineyard, shall not only admit of <i>Loyterers</i>, and such as by
their evill example discourage others, but also shall give to such the
bread and wages which belongs to them who are faithfull and
industrious, should he not be accounted a very unjust and unfaithfull
Steward, and an abuser of his trust?</p>

<p>2. <i>They should be guilty of polluting and prophaning the</i>
Sacrament. If a Minister should give this Sacrament to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">{56}</a></span>
an Infant, or to a Mad-man, or to a meer fool; or to
a Swine, or a Dog, would not all men say this were a
horrible prophanation thereof? <i>Shall it then seem a small
prophanation to give it unto one who is as ignorant as an Infant,
and walloweth as a Swine in the mire of sin and uncleanness?</i></p>

<p>3. <i>They should express a great deal of cruelty and inhumanity to
the soul of him to whom they give the Sacrament</i>; because they give
it to one who will eat and drink his own damnation.</p>

<p>4. <i>They will hereby make themselves accessary to his sin of
unworthy receiving</i>; For it is a certain Rule in Divinity; <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_83" id="Ref_83" href="#Foot_83">[83]</a></span><i>He
that suffers a man to commit sin, when it is in his power to hinder
him, is accessory to the sin that that man commits</i>; as appears by
the <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_84" id="Ref_84" href="#Foot_84">[84]</a></span>example
of <i>Eli</i>: And therefore, if the Officers of the
Church that are deputed by Christ to keep grosly ignorant, or
scandalous, from the Sacrament, shall yet notwithstanding suffer them
to come, and can hinder them, but will not, they themselves become
guilty of his sin.</p>

<p>5. <i>They do hereby grieve the Godly, that are members of the same
Congregation, and as much as in them lies, they pollute &amp; defile the
whole Congregation: For know you not</i>, saith the Apostle, <i>that a
little Leaven leaveneth the whole lump?</i></p>

<p>6. Adde lastly, that hereby they bring down the <i>judgments of God
upon the Congregation</i>; according to that text, 1&nbsp;Cor. 11.30.
<i>For this cause many are sick.</i></p>

<p>From all this, we argue thus; If Church-Officers under the Old
Testament had an authoritative power to separate between the holy and
prophane; and if under the New Testament they have a power to keep out
from the Sacrament, such as are grosly ignorant, or scandalously
wicked; and if it be the Will of Christ, that the Officers of the
Church should be faithful Stewards of the Mysteries of Christ, that
they should not pervert, nor pollute his Ordinance; that they should
not be cruel to the souls of their Brethren, or be partakers of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">{57}</a></span>
other mens sins, that they should not grieve the Godly,
nor bring guilt and judgment upon the Congregation of
which they are Officers: Then it is the Will of Christ,
that they should not give the Sacrament to such, who
are grosly ignorant, and scandalously wicked.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3. Proposition.</div>

<p><i>That it is the Will</i> of Christ, <i>that</i> Church-Governours
<i>have some sufficient way to discover who are such ignorant and
scandalous persons, that they may be kept away</i>.</p>

<p>This followeth clearly from the two former Proportions. For if it be
the Will of Christ, that no grosly ignorant, or scandalous person
should come to the Sacrament; and if they offer to come, should be
kept back by Church-Officers; then it follows, That they must have
sufficient way to detect who are ignorant and scandalous. <i>For
Christ never wills any end, but he wills also all necessary and
sufficient mean, conducing to that end.</i></p>

<p>Now what sufficient means can be propounded or imagined, for detection
of ignorant or scandalous persons, but by examination before these
Church-Officers; examination, we say, of the persons themselves in
case of ignorance, and of witnesses also in the case of scandal. For
though in some particular cases for private satisfaction, private
conference with the Minister alone may sufficiently discover the
knowledge or ignorance of persons, yet in this common case, for
publique satisfaction touching the fitness of persons for the Lords
Supper, no lesse then a publike and judicial examination before the
Eldership can be sufficient; inasmuch as an authoritative act of
admitting, or refusing the persons so examined, depends thereupon.</p>

<p>To illustrate this;</p>

<p>If a man by his last Will and Testament, should leave unto the Master
and Fellows of a Colledge in trust a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
sum of money; to be distributed to hopeful poor schollars,
such as were well verst in the learned Arts and
Tongues: Would it not hence follow?</p>

<p>1. That those <i>Trustees</i> have a power granted them by the Will,
to examine those that come to desire that Legacie.</p>

<p>2. That if any refuse to be examined, or upon examination be found
insufficiently qualified, they have authority to refuse them.</p>

<p>3. That the most sufficient, proper, and satisfactory way, is not to
trust to Reports or Testimonials, but to examine the persons
themselves that sue for such a Legacie: So in the present case, Jesus
Christ hath left as a Legacie, the <i>Sacrament of his Body and
Bloud</i>, and hath left the Church-Officers in trust with it, and
hath said in his Will, That no grosly ignorant, or scandalous person
ought to come to partake thereof; and if any come, that he be debarred
from it by those Church-Officers. Hence it followeth inevitably.</p>

<p>1. <i>That those in trust have power to examine such as desire to
partake of this</i> Legacie, <i>whether they be of sufficient
knowledg, and of good conversation, or no</i>. 2. <i>That they have
power to refuse all such as either refuse to be examined, or upon
examination, are found insufficient.</i> 3. <i>That if the Church
Officers would give up their account with joy at the great day of
judgment, they ought not to rest satisfied with private Reports or
Informations of others; but to examine the persons themselves, that
thereby they may faithfully discharge their trust in a matter of so
great concernment</i>; And that they that will have the Sacrament,
according to the will of Christ, ought first to submit themselves to
such examination.</p>

<p>Besides this that hath been said, to prove that those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">{59}</a></span>
that would come to the Sacrament ought first to submit
to examination; We shall further offer these following
Arguments.</p>

<p>1. We argue from that general exhortation of the Apostle,
1 <i>Pet.</i> 3.15. <i>But sanctifie the Lord God in your hearts, and be
ready alwayes to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason
of the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear.</i></p>

<p>Now if Christians are bound to give an account of their Faith and hope
to every one that asketh them, <i>yea even to heathen Persecutors</i>:
how much more ought they to do it to the Officers of the Church?
especially at such a time, when they desire to be admitted to an
<i>Ordinance</i> that is not common to all sorts of Christians, but
peculiar to such as are indued with knowledg, and of an unblameable
life and conversation.</p>

<p>2. <i>From that power that Jesus Christ hath seated in his
Church, of examining such as are by the Will of Christ to be
excommunicated from the Sacrament.</i> That there is a
power of examining, in order to excommunication,
appears from Matth. 18.16, 17. and from Revel. 2.2.
where Christ commends <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_85" id="Ref_85" href="#Foot_85">[85]</a></span>the
Angel of the Church of
<i>Ephesus</i>, <i>because he could not bear them which were evill,
and had tryed them who said, they were Apostles, and were
not, and had found them lyars</i>. This trying was not only
<i>charitative</i>, and <i>fraternall</i>, but <i>authoritative</i> and <i>judiciall</i>.
For it was an act of the Angel of the Church; which
Angel is not to be understood individually, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_86" id="Ref_86" href="#Foot_86">[86]</a></span>but collectively,
for all the Angels in <i>Ephesus</i>. And that there
were more Angels then one in <i>Ephesus</i>, appears from
<i>Act.</i> 20.17. (The like may be said of the Angel of the
Church of <i>Smyrna</i>, <i>Pergamus</i>, <i>Thyatira</i>, &amp;c. for Christ
speaks unto each Angel in the plural number, Rev. 2.10, 13, 14.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
From hence we argue, <i>If Iesus Christ hath given power
Authoritatively, to examine such as are to be cast out from the
Sacrament, then he hath also given power to examine such as are to be
received in</i>. For there is the same reason of both. And as the
power of excommunication would be wholly useless and frustraneous, if
there were not a power of examination precedent thereunto; so would
the power of keeping such as are grosly ignorant or scandalous, from
the Sacrament, be utterly in vain, and of no benefit to the Church of
Christ, if the power of examination should be denyed unto it. And
certainly, whosoever is an enemy to this power, must be forced to
grant, that it is the <i>Will of Iesus Christ</i>, that all sorts of
people, though never so wicked, though actually drunk, though fooles,
though Turks, Iews, or Heathen, are to be admitted to the Sacrament,
if they come unto it.</p>

<p><i>For if there be no divine right of Examination, or of rejection,
how dare any Church or State assume a power of making rules for
keeping any persons from the Sacrament?</i> should they make rules for
keeping ignorant and scandalous persons from the hearing of the Word,
would it not be accounted a sin of an high nature? And is it not as
great a sin to keep any from the Sacrament, if Christ hath left no
power for the doing of it? is not this to be wise above what is
written? And therefore let us either admit all sorts to the Sacrament,
without any distinction of persons, and thereby become guilty of the
body and blood of Christ, and accessary to the sins of those that come
unworthily; (as hath been said, and formerly proved,) or else let us
diligently and conscientiously examine all of all sorts, that desire
to be made partakers of this distinguishing ordinance.</p>

<p>3. From the titles that are given to the Officers of the Church, and
from the duty that God requires at their hands. The Officers of the
Church are called <i>Rulers</i> and <i>Governours</i>, &amp; such as are
<i>over their people in the Lord</i>. And it is their duty <i>to watch
over the souls of their people, as such as must give an account for
them into God</i>. Now it is all the reason in the world, that they
that must <i>give an account to God for their people, should take an
account of their people</i>; and that they that <i>watch over their
souls, should know the state of their souls</i>. And that they that
are <i>Governours,</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">{61}</a></span>
<i>Rulers, and Overseers, should teach, instruct, try and
examine those over whom they rule and govern</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_87" id="Ref_87" href="#Foot_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Quest.</div>

<p>But you will say, who are these <i>Rulers and Governours</i>, by whom
we are to be examined?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></div>

<p>The Answer to this, will lead us to the third thing propounded; and
that is to prove,</p>

<div class="sidenote">The 3. Particular.</div>

<p><i>That the power of examining those that desire to be admitted to the
Lords Supper, belongs not to the Minister alone, nor to the Minister
with the whole Church, but to the Minister &amp; Ruling Elders.</i></p>

<p>1. <i>Not to the Minister alone.</i> Indeed there is an examination,
which belongs only to the teaching-Elder, and that is <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_88" id="Ref_88" href="#Foot_88">[88]</a></span>a catechizing of
his people in publique, by questions and answers; and this is part of
the key of doctrine.</p>

<p>But the <i>examination</i> that we are now treating of, belongs to
<i>Discipline and Government</i>; for it is not only a naked
examination, but an <i>authoritative determining whether the party
examined shall be detained from the</i> Sacrament, <i>or admitted</i>;
which is formally an act of Church-Government, and therefore belongs
not to the Minister alone, but to all those whom Christ hath made
Church-Governours, also: of which sort are the Ruling-Elders, as hath
been sufficiently proved. The power of Discipline is given <span
class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span><i>Non uni, sed unitati.</i><span
class="hidev">|</span></span>by Christ,
not to one Elder, but to the united company of Elders: and for one
Minister alone to assume this power unto himself, it is to make
himself the Church; it is to make himself a Congregational Pope; it is
a bringing in of a Power into the Church, that would have some
resemblance (as was objected) to auricular confession.</p>

<p>Now there are two things we are very confident of;</p>

<p>1. That when the Parliament gave their allowance to the Presbyterial
Government, if they had put the whole juridical power of the Church
into the hands of the Minister alone, they that now seem so willing to
come to be examined by the Minister without his Elders, would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">{62}</a></span>
have more bitterly declaimed against that way, then
now they do against this: For this indeed were to make
every Minister a Prelate in his Congregation; and (as
we now said) to bring in that which hath some resemblance
to <i>auricular confession</i>.</p>

<p>2. That it is as warrantable by the Word of God, for one Minister to
assume the whole power unto himself alone, of suspending persons from
the Sacrament, who have been duly admitted thereunto (which is a
graduall excommunication) as it is to assume the whole power of
admitting unto the Sacrament; for <i>contrariorum eadem est ratio</i>.
And oh that our Brethren in the Ministry, that take this power unto
themselves, would seriously consider what is here said.</p>

<p>Secondly, the power cannot be placed in the whole Church collectively
taken; for then it should be also in children and servants. The
Scripture makes an exact distinction between Rulers, and Ruled; and we
are very well assured, that if this power were seated in the Minister
and whole Congregation, that they that are now so unwilling to come
before the Minister and Elders, would be much more unwilling to come
before the Minister, and whole Congregation. And therefore we
conclude, That this power of examining, and receiving unto the
Sacrament such are fit, and detaining such as are found to be grosly
ignorant, and visibly wicked must needs belong to the Minister,
assisted with the Elders, chosen out from amongst the rest of the
Congregation: For if the Elders are Rulers, and Governours, seated by
God in his Church, (as hath been abundantly proved) then it will
undeniably follow, <i>That whatsoever is properly an act of
Government, must belong to them as well as the Minister</i>. And who
can deny, but that the power
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">{63}</a></span>
of admitting unto, or detaining from the Sacrament, is
an act of Government? and therefore it doth by divine
right belong to the Elders, as well as to the Minister.
But yet here we must carefully distinguish between the
<i>act of examination</i>, and the judgment given upon the
person examined. The managing of the Examination,
is the proper act of the teaching Elder; It is he that is to
pray for a blessing; It is he, that is for order sake to ask
the questions. But as for the <i>determining</i>, whether the
party examined be fit or no to receive, this is an act of
power and government, and belongs not to the Minister
alone, but to the Eldership. And it is a very great
wonder unto us, that people should profess so much
dis-satisfaction and dislike, in coming before the
Ruling-Elders whereas they cannot but take notice,</p>

<p>1. <i>That the Elders are such, as they themselves have, or
might have chosen.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>They are chosen for the relief and benefit of the
Congregation.</i> That so the Minister might not be <i>sole judge</i>
of those that are to come to the Sacrament, but might have others
joyned with him, to see that he doth nothing out of envy, malice,
pride, or partiality, but that all things be managed for the good and
edification of them, for whose sake they are chosen: which two
particulars, if our people did seriously consider, they would quickly
be perswaded to a hearty and an unanimous submission unto this
ordinance of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>There remains the fourth thing yet behind, which is an answering of
the objections that are brought against this way of examination by
Minister and Elders. But this, and divers other considerable things,
which we shall propound, to perswade people unto a cheerful obedience
to this part of Church-Reformation, so comfortably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">{64}</a></span>
begun in many Congregations in this Kingdome;
We shall leave, till we come to that part of this discourse,
which we call, The <span class="gesperrt">EXHORTATION</span>;
to which we refer the Candid Reader, that desires further
satisfaction.</p>

<p>And thus we have given you a short survey of the nature of the
Presbyterial Government; together with an answer to the most material
objections against it: which we have done only for this end, that so
(as we have said) we might undeceive those, who look upon it as lordly
and tyrannical; and by these bug-bears, are scared from submitting to
it. And we beseech our several Congregations, to judge of it, as it is
here represented, and to be willing to come under the yoke of it,
which is light and easie, (being the yoke of Christ) and which will in
a short time make our Congregations (if received into them) glorious
for their unity, verity, and piety.</p>

<p>We are not ignorant, that it hath many Adversaries. The obstinately
ignorant hates it, because it will not suffer him to go blindfold to
hell. The prophane person hates it, because it will not suffer him to
eat and drink his own damnation, by unworthy coming to the Sacrament.
The Heretique hates it, because after two or three admonitions, it
rejects him. The Jesuite hates it, because it is an invincible bulwark
to keep out Popery. The Schismatique, because the main design of it,
is to make all the Saints to be of one lip, one heart, and one way.
And above all, the Devil hates it, because if rightly managed, it will
in a short time blow up his kingdome.</p>

<p class="thtbrk">But notwithstanding all these great and potent enemies,
our comfort is, That this Government is the Government of Jesus Christ,
who is the King of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">{65}</a></span>
Church, and hath given unto us the keyes of his Kingdom,
hath promised to be with us, to protect and
defend us to the end of the world; upon whose shoulders
the government is laid; &amp; though we be utterly unable,
yet he that was able to bear the wrath of God upon
his shoulders, is able to bear up this Government against
the wrath of man. For this end and purpose, all
power in heaven and earth is given unto him; and he is
now sitting at the right hand of God, for the more effectual
exercising thereof: and will there remain, till he
hath made all his enemies his foot-stool. Whose priviledge
it is, to rule in the midst of his enemies: And
will one day say, Those mine enemies, which would
not that I should reign over them, bring hither and slay
them before me. <i>Be wise now therefore, O ye Kings,
be instructed ye Judges of the Earth; serve the Lord with
fear, and rejoyce with trembling. Kisse the Son lest he be
angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled
but a little; blessed are all they that put their trust in him.</i></p>

<p class="dropcap-fnt">THere remains the second particular yet behind; and that is
the <i>Vindication of our persons</i>, (especially of such amongst us,
who are teaching Elders,) from the slanders and cruel reproaches that
are cast upon us; which we shall undertake, not so much for our own,
as for our peoples sake, lest hereby our Ministry should be rendred
useless and ineffectual; for (as <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_89" id="Ref_89" href="#Foot_89">[89]</a></span><i>Austine</i>
saith) <i>though a
Ministers good conscience is sufficient for himself, yet his good name
is necessary for his people</i>: who ordinarily dis-esteem the
Doctrine of him, whose person they dis-esteem. We thank God, we can
say with the Apostle, with us, <i>It is a very small thing that we
should be judged of mans judgment: He that judgeth us is the Lord.</i>
We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span>
remember what the Apostle tells us in that little Book
of Martyrs, of divers Saints, whose <i>shoe-latchets we are
not worthy to untye; who endured cruell mockings, yea moreover
bonds and imprisonments, they were stoned, they were
sawn assunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword</i>, &amp;c.
<i>of whom the world was not worthy</i>, and yet even they were
not <i>thought worthy to live in the world</i>. And therefore
we can with the more willingness, suffer our selves to
be the <i>But</i> of every mans malice, and the subject of every
dayes Pamphlet. We read, that even <i>Elias</i> himself
was called the <i>troubler of Israel</i>, by him who was the
chief <i>troubler thereof</i>. And that Saint <i>Paul</i>, who was
wrapt up into the third heaven, was accused by <i>Tertullus</i>,
to be <i>a Pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among
all the Jews throughout the world</i>. And that the Primitive
Confessors and Martyrs, famous for the holiness of
their lives, were charged before the Heathen Emperors,
to be the vildest of men; to be first murderers, and then
eaters of their own children; to be guilty of incestuous
marriages, and in their private meetings to commit uncleanness.
And their Religion also was represented, as
the cause of all the Earthquakes, famines, plagues, and
other miseries of those times.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_90" id="Ref_90" href="#Foot_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>We have formerly made mention of the reproaches which the
<i>Anabaptists</i> of <i>Germany</i> cast upon <i>Luther</i>; and we
might adde the horrible and prodigious lies &amp; slanders raised by the
<i>Arians</i> against <i>Athanasius</i>, that great Champion of Jesus
Christ, and the hideous and strange reports, and bitter invectives of
<i>Michael Servetus</i> and <i>Bolseck</i>, against <i>Calvin</i>. But
that which doth quiet our spirits, more then all this, is, the
consideration of Christ Jesus himself, who when he was here upon
Earth, was accused to be an <i>Enemy to</i> Cæsar, <i>a friend to</i>
Publicans
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">{67}</a></span>
<i>and</i> Sinners, <i>a Glutton and a Wine-bibber</i>, &amp;c. <i>It is enough
for the</i> Disciple <i>that he be as his</i> Master, <i>and the</i> Servant
<i>as his</i> Lord; <i>if they have called the Master of the house</i> Belzebub;
<i>how much more shall they call them of his Houshold?</i></p>

<p>As for the particular accusations that are charged upon us, they are,
we confess, very many, and very great; and if to be accused, were
sufficient to make us guilty, we were of all men most miserable. But
we hope it may be said of us, as it was once of <i>Cato</i>, <i>That as he
was 32. times accused, so he was 32. times cleared and absolved</i>.
And we trust, that the Lord will in due time, dispell all these thick
mists and fogs which our adversaries have raised up against us, and
bring forth at last our <i>Righteousnesse as the light, and our
judgment as the noon day</i>. And we do here profess before the great
God, that in all the great changes that have bin lately made amongst
us, it hath been our great endeavour to keep our selves unchanged,
making the <i>unchangeable Word</i> our <i>Rule</i>, and the
<i>unchangeable God</i> our <i>Rock</i>. And we are confident, that no
man will account us <i>Apostatized from our principles</i>, but such
as are in a great measure <i>Apostatized from their own
professions</i>. There are some men that <i>Proteus</i>-like, can
transform them into all shapes, for their own advantage, according to
the times wherein they live; and <i>Camelion-like</i>, can change
themselves into any colour but white, can turn any thing, but what
they should be. And because we cannot change our consciences with the
times, as some do; therefore, and therefore only, are we counted
<i>Changlings</i>. It is just with such men, as with men in a ship at
Sea, that will not be perswaded, but that the shore they pass by
moves, and not the ship wherein they are. As for Us, we are, and hope
(through Gods grace) ever shall be fixt and immoveable in our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">{68}</a></span>
first principles. We were not the causers of the first
War, between King and Parliament; but were called
by the Parliament to their assistance: and the ground
of our ingaging with them was, <i>The Propositions and Orders
of the Lords, and Commons in Parl. Jun. 10. 1642.</i> for
bringing in of mony and plate, &amp;c. wherein they assured
us, that whatever should be brought in thereupon,
should not at all be employed upon any other occasion,
<i>Then to maintain the Protestant Religion, the Kings
authority and his person, in his Royall Dignity; the free
course of justice; the Laws of the Land, the peace of the
Kingdom; and the Priviledges of Parliament, against any
force which shall oppose them.</i> And in this we were daily
confirmed &amp; incouraged more and more, by their many
subsequent Declarations and Protestations, which
we held our selves bound to believe, knowing many of
them godly and conscientious men, of publique Spirits,
zealously promoting the good both of Church and
State. The War we ingaged in by Authority of Parliament,
was only defensive, (which not only <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_91" id="Ref_91" href="#Foot_91">[91]</a></span>Bishop
<i>Bilson</i>, and <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_92" id="Ref_92" href="#Foot_92">[92]</a></span>Bishop
<i>Bedell</i>, but divers others of the Prelatical
way hold to be just and warrantable.) We never
opposed the King further, then He opposed His own
Laws: Our aym in all that great Undertaking (as the
great Heart-searcher knows) was to <i>secure Religion, to
preserve the Government of the Kingdom, and to remove the
Wicked from before the King, that his Throne might be established
in Righteousness</i>.</p>

<p>And this Act of ours, was not at all contrary to the <i>Oath</i> of
<i>Allegeance</i> which we have taken; because the intent of that Oath
can be no other, then to oblige to obey the King, according to the
Laws of the Kingdome; and to our knowledg, we never disobeyed the King
in his legall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span>
and political capacity; though we confess we did,
and by the Law were allowed to deny obedience unto
him in his personall capacity, when it did cross his
legall. And therefore they that charge us so deeply,
and reiterate their charge by their multiplyed Pamphlets,
<i>That we Ministers are the cause of all the Murders and
Blood sheddings of these late years, and other horrid practices
which we forbear to mention, have the greater sin</i>.</p>

<p>But our comfort is, the witness of our Consciences, and the integrity
of our Carriages; and we doubt not but we can truly appeal, as
<i>David</i>, did when he was accused for seeking the life of
<i>Saul</i>. <i>The Lord judg between them and us, and plead our
cause, and deliver us out of the hands of these cruell and
unreasonable accusers.</i> This is all we shall return in answer to
the first War; As for the second War, we profess, we stand amazed at
the impudency of that man<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_93" id="Ref_93" href="#Foot_93">[93]</a></span>,
who is not afraid, even against his own
conscience (we fear) to say of the Presbyterian Ministers, <i>That
they did separate their consecrated Lungs, for Bellows to blow up the
Coals amongst the People this last Summer; That they were the Ghostly
Fathers of all or the greatest part of those Anti-Parliamentary
Barabasses, who so lately commenced Masters of Mis-rule in</i> Surrey,
Sussex, Kent, Essex, Wales, &amp;c. <i>That in stead of lifting up their
voyces like Trumpets, to cause the People to know their abominations,
they lift them up like Trumpets, to prepare them to commit
abominations, &amp;c.</i> That Tumults, Insurrections, and Rebellions of
the People against Authority, <i>in order to the advancement of High
Presbytery, seem lawfull, yea, and commendable practices unto many of
them</i>. To all which, and Multitudes of such like cruel invectives,
we return the answer of the Archangel, <i>Jude</i> 9. <i>The Lord rebuke
thee.</i> It is well known to all that are not wilfully and
maliciously blind, what help the Presbyterian Ministers and People did
contribute towards the quenching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">{70}</a></span>
of those flames; and that in all probability, the Army
had been utterly destroyed, had not the Presbyterian
Forces in <i>Lancashire</i>, <i>Suffolk</i>, <i>Essex</i>, and in divers other
places (incouraged by the Ministers) come in timously,
and vigorously to their assistance. And the time was,
when this was ingenuously acknowledged by one of
the chiefest of the Army, though the forementioned
Pamphleter, possessed with prejudice against us, will
not remember any such thing; and though some of us
be like to be dealt withall by way of recompence, just
as <i>M. Tullius Cicero</i> was, who had his head cut off by
<i>Popilius Lænas</i>, whose head he had saved from cutting
off; or as <i>Constans</i>, the Son of <i>Constantine</i> the great was
served, who was kil'd by one <i>Magnentius</i>, whose life he
had formerly preserved.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_94" id="Ref_94" href="#Foot_94">[94]</a></span>
And what the Ministers of
<i>London</i> in particular did in this kind, is well known to all
unprejudiced Citizens. We did not abet (as we are
falsly accused) but abhor and detest, that <i>horrid violence
offered to the Parliament, upon that fatall Munday</i>,
July 6. 1647. We have always been, and still are friends
to the <i>Priviledges of Parliament, according to our Covenant</i>.
And for this very cause it is, even because we will
not break the priviledges of Parliament, that we suffer
so deeply from these kind of men at this day. Although
we could (if recriminations were good answers) put
them in mind of Pamphlets, not a few, written by them,
and those of their way, <i>in justification of as horrid acts of
violence offered to the Parliament</i>. When the Scottish
Army came last into <i>England</i>, (though we are shamefully
traduced, as if we had encouraged and invited
them to come in,) yet our consciences do witness with
us, and our <i>Auditors</i> can testifie for us, that we did unanimously
oppose them, as men that pretended the <i>Covenant</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">{71}</a></span>
but acted quite contrary unto it. We profess,
that in conscience we are bound, and in practice we
shall endeavour to obey <i>lawfull Authority in all lawfull
things</i>; and when we cannot actively obey, we shall
be ready <i>passively to submit</i>. If our hearts deceive us not,
we have no design but the <i>glory of God</i>, <i>no interest like
that of Religion</i>. We desire more to <i>sow spiritualls</i>, then
<i>reap temporalls</i>. And that Christ and his Gospel, may
be exalted, though upon our ruines. Pardon us, that
we become fools in glorifying, for ye have compelled
us. We hunt not after tythes, and great Livings, but
seek the salvation of our peoples souls; and had our enemies
a window into our hearts, they would finde these
our professions to be true and unfeigned. And yet we
must crave leave to tell these men, <i>That the design of taking
away Tythes from the Ministry, was first invented by
that cursed Apostate</i> Julian, <i>who (as Mr.</i> Stock <i>that Reverend,
pious, and painfull Preacher hath observed<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_95" id="Ref_95" href="#Foot_95">[95]</a></span>,) by
this means is noted, more to have overthrown the Church, then all
the Persecuting Emperours before him. Because they took away
Presbyters, and their Martyrs blood was the seed of the Church,
but he took away Presbyterium, the Ministry it self, in withdrawing
the maintenance from the Church, and so overthrew the
Worship of God.</i> As for our way of preaching, though
we are far from justifying any <i>indiscreet and passionate
expressions</i>, yet we conceive it to be very hard measure,
to have our integrity arraigned and condemned for humane
infirmities. And we hope we may, without boasting,
say thus much; That the <i>setled Ministry of England</i>
was never more <i>censured, molested, impoverished and
yet never more pious, peaceable, and painfull</i>. And that our
condition in this juncture of affaires, is just like that of
the <i>Romane, That had a suit commenced against him, because
he did not receive the sword of his enemy far enough into</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">{72}</a></span>
<i>his bowels</i>. And that therefore it is that some men
rail against us, because we will not break our <i>Oaths and
Covenants</i>, and will not <i>serve the times</i>, but <i>serve the
Lord</i>. It is a great refreshing to us, to consider the wise
dispensation of God, in ordering the affaires of this
Kingdome, so, as he hath thereby discovered the hidden
hypocrisie and cousenage of many men, unto those
who otherwise would not have believed it. And we
earnestly intreat these men to consider, as in the sight
of God, before whose dreadfull judgment Seat, both
we and they must shortly give an account of all
things done in these our mortall bodies; Whether in
that dreadful day it will appear a <i>righteous thing</i>, If
those who have cryed down <i>Persecution so much</i>, should
now themselves become the <i>greatest Persecutors</i>. And if
they who have formerly abhorred others, as men transported
with an <i>Antichristian spirit</i>, but for a bare suspition,
that if they got power into their hands, they
would prove <i>cruell and tyrannicall to poor tender consciences</i>,
should now actually attempt to do that themselves,
the which upon bare suspition, they did condemn in
others: And if any who have accused others for seeking
great Offices, and places of gain and preferment, should
now manifest themselves to be none of the least self-seekers.
Alas! who knows, or can discern the deceitfulness
of our hearts? and that if we give way upon meer
outward occurrences, to change our principles, but
that upon further changes, the Righteous Lord may
leave us to Satans stronger delusions, to transport us further,
then at present can come in our hearts to imagine;
that so after all the glorious beginnings in the Spirit,
we should fearfully Apostatize, and end in the flesh. For
our parts, we tremble to think of those formidable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">{73}</a></span>
Judgments of our Righteous God. And our prayer to
God is, that he would keep us sincere in all changes,
and that he would plead our cause for us. And our <i>rejoycing,
is the testimony of our consciences, that in simplicity
and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdome, but by the grace
of God, we have had our conversation in the world</i>. It is
the integrity of our consciences, that carries us above all
the reproaches and slanders that are cast upon us: and
that makes us go on in doing our duties, maugre all
opposition; and to commit the maintaining of his own
cause, and the cleering of our callings and persons unto
the Lord, who judgeth righteously.</p>

<h2>The EXHORTATION.</h2>
<hr />

<div>
<img class="dropcap-ill" src="images/drop-h.png" alt="drop-h" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap-ill-h">HAving thus in few words, vindicated both our Government and our
Persons, we conceive it necessary to subjoyn an Exhortation unto all
the Ministers, and Elders, and people, that are within the Province;
which we shall branch into these ensuing particulars:</p>

<p>1. We shall direct our speech <i>unto the Ministers and Ruling Elders,
that have accepted of, and do act according to the Rules of the
Presbyterian Government, as they are conjoyned in one and the same
Presbytery</i>.</p>

<p>2. <i>Unto those of our respective Congregations, that submit unto the
Government, and are admitted unto the Sacrament of the body and blood
of Christ, in the Presbyterian way.</i></p>

<p>3. <i>Unto those that live within the bounds of the Province, and have
not yet submitted to the Government, nor are admitted</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">{74}</a></span>
<i>to the Sacrament, in the Presbyteriall way.</i></p>

<p>1. We shall direct our speech unto the Ministers and Ruling-Elders,
that have accepted of, and do act according to the Rules of the
Presbyterian Government, as they are conjoyned in one and the same
Presbytery.</p>

<p>That which we have to say unto them, is,</p>

<p>To perswade them to be <i>faithfull in the discharge of
the great trust committed unto them</i>. To be a <i>Ruler in
Gods house</i>, as it is a place of <i>great honour</i>, so also of <i>great
trust</i>; and he that hath this trust committed unto him,
ought to be one of a thousand. It is a good saying of
an Heathen, <i>Magistratus virum indicat</i>, Magistracy will
try a man what he is, so will this office you. Such are
the mountains of opposition you are like to meet withall;
such is the courage you must put on; such is the
wisdome and piety you must be cloathed withall, that
we may truly say with the Apostle, <i>Who is sufficient for
these things?</i> As <i>Tacitus</i> saith of <i>Galba</i>, that he was <i>Capax
imperii, nisi imperasset</i>, thought very fit to have been
an <i>Emperour</i>, had he not been an <i>Emperour</i>; so there are
many that have been thought fit to be <i>Elders</i>, till they
were made <i>Elders</i>. Many that seemed very good, when
private Christians; when advanced into places of trust,
have proved very wicked. To have the <i>body and blood
of Christ Sacramentall in your custody</i>; To be made <i>Keepers
of Christs Vineyard</i>, and <i>watchmen over his flock</i>; To
have the <i>keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven</i> committed unto
you: This is not only a great honour, but a great burden.
And therefore it must be your exceeding great
care, so to behave your selves in the Church of God,
which is his house, that you may give up your account with
joy at that great day. For this purpose we Exhort
you;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">{75}</a></span>
1. That you would labour to discharge your Office with care and
diligence, according to the advice of the Apostle, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_96" id="Ref_96" href="#Foot_96">[96]</a></span><i>Let him that
Ruleth, Rule with diligence</i>. The Apostle foresaw how negligent
Elders would be, in the trust committed unto them; and therefore he
chose to lay this speciall injunction upon them. You must not suffer
the key of discipline to rust for want of using, but must remember,
that the life of discipline is in the execution; and that the
<i>unprofitable servant was cast into Hell, not for abusing; but for
not improving of his Talent</i>.</p>

<p>2. That you would study to Rule with all humility and Self-denyal, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_97" id="Ref_97" href="#Foot_97">[97]</a></span>not
as lording it over Gods heritage, but as being examples to the flock,
remembring the saying of our blessed Saviour, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_98" id="Ref_98" href="#Foot_98">[98]</a></span><i>The
Kings of the Gentiles exercise Lordship; And they that exercise authority upon
them, are called Benefactors: But ye shall not be so. But he that is
greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is
chief</i>, (or, as it is in the Greek<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_99" id="Ref_99" href="#Foot_99">[99]</a></span>,
he that Ruleth,) <i>as he that
serveth</i>. You must not be as <i>Diotrephes</i> who loved to have
the <i>Preheminence</i>; not as the <i>Pharisees, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_100" id="Ref_100" href="#Foot_100">[100]</a></span>who loved the
uppermost roomes at feasts, and the chief seats in the Synagogue</i>.</p>

<p>3. That you would labour to Rule the Church of God with all
<i>peaceablenesse</i>, and <i>quietness</i>; doing nothing out of
contention, envy, or malice; but all out of pure love, with the spirit
of meekness and patience. That the people may read love and gentleness
written upon all your admonitions and censures. <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_101" id="Ref_101" href="#Foot_101">[101]</a></span><i>For
the servant of the Lord must not strive, but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach,
patient, in all meekness instructing those that oppose themselves, if
God peradventure will give them repentance, to the acknowledgment of
the truth; And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of
the Devill, who are taken</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">{76}</a></span>
<i>captive by him at his will.</i> Famous is the saying of our
Saviour, <i>Have salt in your selves, and peace one with another</i>.
By <i>salt</i>, is meant (as <i>Chemnitius</i> and others observe,)
<i>sincere doctrine and discipline</i> whereby the people
of God are seasoned, and kept from the putrefaction
of sin and errour; this <i>salt</i> is so to be sprinkled, as that
if it be possible, it may have peace joyned with it. <i>Have
salt in your selves, and peace one with another.</i> There are
that think, that sincere discipline and peace cannot stand
together, but they are confuted by Christs own words.
The readiest way to have true peace one with another,
is to have salt within our selves. There are indeed, some
Congregations, that have this salt, without this peace;
which is a misery to be exceedingly bewailed. There are
others which have <i>peace</i> without this <i>salt</i>, but this <i>peace</i>
is a wicked <i>peace</i>; a peace with sin and errour, which will
end in damnation. But blessed and happy are those Congregations,
that have <i>salt in themselves, and true Christian
peace one with another</i>. A Church-Officer must not be a
<i>bramble</i>, rending and tearing the people committed to
his charge, but as a <i>fig tree</i>, <i>vine</i>, and <i>olive tree</i>, refreshing
them with his <i>fatnesse, swetnesse, and fruitfulnesse</i>.</p>

<p>4. That you would labour to make your Congregations pure, as well as
peaceable; following after piety, as much as verity and unity. That
all your people under your charge, may be visible Saints at least. It
is the great complaint that some take up against the <i>Presbyteriall
Government</i>, that it studieth unity and truth, but neglecteth
holiness and purity. And therefore we beseech you Brethren, by our
Lord Jesus Christ, who is called <i>the holy One</i>, that you would
labour to free the Government from this scandal. If there be any under
your inspection grosly ignorant, or of scandalous life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">{77}</a></span>
and conversation, you ought not to admit him to the
Sacrament; for if you do, you are accessary to his sin
of unworthy receiving; you are instrumentall to the
damnation of his soul, you pollute the ordinance; you
offend the godly amongst you; you render the Government
obnoxious to just exception; and you bring down
the heavy judgments of God upon the Congregation.
If there be any that after admission prove scandalous,
you are to admonish him; and if he continue obstinate,
you are <i>to put away from among your selves that wicked
person</i>, to purge out the <i>old leaven</i>, that you may be a
<i>new lump</i>. And this you are to do:</p>

<p>1. <i>For the Churches sake</i>; that the Church in which
you are Rulers, may not be infected; <i>for know you not,
that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?</i></p>

<p>2. <i>For the sinners sake</i>; you must deliver such a one
<i>unto Satan</i>, for the <i>destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may
be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus</i>.</p>

<p>3. <i>For Christs sake</i>, that his name may not be dishonoured,
and that he may not be forced to depart from
your Assemblies.</p>

<p>4. <i>For the Ordinances sake</i>, that they may not be polluted.</p>

<p>5. <i>For your own sakes</i>, that you may not be damned for other mens
sins.</p>

<p>Oh that our words might take impression upon all your hearts, that are
Ministers and Elders within the Province! what a glorious thing were
it, if it might be said of all our Congregations, that they are not
only <i>true</i>, but <i>pure Churches, and Churches united in love,
and in the truth</i>? How would this tend to the honour of Jesus
Christ, the King of his Church? How would this make him delight to
dwell in the midst of you? How would this stop the mouthes of
Anabaptists, Brownists, and Independents? How would the blood of Jesus
Christ be preserved from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></span>
prophanation, and the wicked in time gained to repentance,
and the blessing of God be upon us, together with
peace and plenty in all our dwellings?</p>

<p>We beseech you once more, by the blood of Jesus Christ, which was shed
for your souls, that you would not prostitute it to open sinners, but
use all possible means to make your Congregations more and more pure.
For this purpose, consider, what the Directory for Church-Government,
advisedly and religiously requireth of you, namely, <i>That where
there are many Ruling-Officers in a particular Congregation, some of
them do more especially attend the inspection of one part, some of
another, as may be most convenient. And some of them are, at fit
times, to visit the several families for their spiritual good.</i> And
for the better inabling you to do these things, we exhort you further:</p>

<p>5. That you would labour to abound more and more
in all <i>knowledge</i>, and <i>soundnesse of judgement</i>, <i>and in all
manner of godly conversation</i>; for he that would be fit to
<i>purge</i> Gods house of ignorance and scandal, must first
<i>purge</i> himself of ignorance and scandal. <i>Church-purification</i>
and reformation, must begin in <i>self-purification</i> and
reformation. He that will reprove sin in others, must be
free from that sin himself; otherwise it will be said, <i>Thou
hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye, and then
thou shalt see clearly, to cast out the moat out of thy brothers
eye</i>. And he must be free from all other scandalous sins
also; otherwise men will be ready to say, This man reproveth
me for drunkenness, but he himself is covetous;
he reproveth me for swearing, but he himself
will lie. And therefore our prayer to God for you is,
<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_102" id="Ref_102" href="#Foot_102">[102]</a></span><i>That
you may be filled with the fruits of Righteousness, which
are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God, that</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">{79}</a></span>
<i>your love may abound yet more and more, in knowledge, and
in all judgment; that ye may approve the things that are
excellent: That ye may be sincere, and without offence, till
the day of Christ</i>. For you are appointed by Christ to
convince gain-sayers, and therefore you had need to let
the Word of God dwell in you richly, in all wisdom,
especially in these dayes, wherein there are many unruly
and vain talkers, and deceivers, whose mouthes
must be stopped; who subvert whole houses, teaching
things they ought not, for filthy lucres sake. You are
appointed by Christ, to be examples to the flock. And
that which is but a little sin in others, will be a great one
in you. Your sins are not sins, but monsters: You are
like <i>Looking-glasses</i>, according to which, others dresse
themselves; you are like pictures in a glass-window,
every little blemish will be quickly seen in you: Your
lives are looked upon as <i>Presidents</i>, your examples, as
<i>Rules</i>: And therefore you ought to be <i>exemplarily
holy</i>, or else you shall receive the <i>greater condemnation</i>.</p>

<p>6. That you would labour to be <i>good in all your relations</i>, good
<i>Parents</i>, good <i>Masters</i>, good <i>Husbands</i>, dwelling with your
wives according to knowledge, as being heires together of the grace of
life, that your prayers be not hindered: <i>For if a man know not how
to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the Church of
God?</i> How shall he be a good Ruling Elder, that doth not rule well
his own house, <i>having his children in subjection with all
gravity</i>? How can he perswade others to set up the worship of God
in their families, that hath none in his own? And therefore, that you
may rule the better in Gods Church, you must make your <i>houses</i>
as it were <i>little Churches</i>.</p>

<p>7. That you would labour to be men of <i>publique spirits</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">{80}</a></span>
seeking the things of Christ before, and more then
your own; mourning more for the miseries of the
Church, then your own; and rejoycing more in the
prosperity of <i>Sion</i>, then your own.</p>

<p>A Church-Officer must be like old <i>Eli</i>, who was more
troubled at the losse of the <i>Ark</i>, then the death of his
two sons. And like the Psalmist, that bewailed more
the <i>burning of Gods house</i>, then his own; and the desolation
of <i>Gods Church</i>, then of the <i>Kingdome</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_103" id="Ref_103" href="#Foot_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>8. That you would labour to be of a <i>liberall and free spirit,
feeding the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight
thereof, not by constraint, but willingly, not for filthy lucre, but
of a ready mind</i>. A Covetous <i>Judas</i> will betray Jesus Christ
for thirty pieces of silver, and sell a good conscience for a messe of
pottage; and be prodigal of the blood of Christ, rather then lose his
trading.</p>

<p>9. That you would labour to be of a <i>courageous and
resolute spirit, valiant for the truth and cause of God</i>; as
<i>Luther</i> was, who alone opposed a world of Enemies;
and as <i>Athanasius</i>, who was both as an <i>Adamant</i>, and a
<i>Loadstone</i>, in his private converse<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_104" id="Ref_104" href="#Foot_104">[104]</a></span>;
he was very courteous
and affable, drawing all men to him, even as a Loadstone
doth iron; but in the cause of God, and of his
truth, he was <i>unmoveable</i>, and <i>unconquerable</i> as an
Adamant. There is nothing will cause you sooner to apostatize
from your Principles, and from your practices,
then base fear of men. This made even <i>Peter deny Christ</i>;
and <i>David</i>, run to the <i>Philistines</i>, &amp; <i>Abraham</i>, to dissemble.
The Wise man saith, <i>The fear of man bringeth a snare,
but who so putteth his trust in the Lord, shall be safe.</i> Our
prayer to God for you, is, That the <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_105" id="Ref_105" href="#Foot_105">[105]</a></span><i>Lord would speak
unto you with a strong hand; and instruct you, that you may
not walk in the way of this people, saying a Confederacy unto</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">{81}</a></span>
<i>those unto whom this people shall say a Confederacy; nor
fear their fear: but sanctifie the Lord of hosts in your hearts,
and make him your fear and your dread</i>. And you have a
most blessed promise added, That <i>Jesus Christ will be
unto you for a Sanctuary</i>, to protect and defend you in the
day of your greatest fears and dangers.</p>

<p>10. That you would labour to be of a <i>tender spirit</i>,
tender of the honour of God, of the blood of Christ Sacramental,
of the souls of the people committed to your
charge, of the truths and Government of Christ. A
Church-Officer must not be a <i>Gallio</i>, not caring what
becomes of Religion, and the interest of Christ. Nor a
luke-warm <i>Laodicean</i>, neither hot nor cold, lest he be
spewed out of the mouth of Christ. But he must be a
<i>Josiah</i>, whose commendation was this, that his <i>heart was
tender</i>, a <i>David</i>, <i>whose eyes ran down with rivers of tears,
because men kept not the law</i>: a <i>Jeremiah</i>, who wished,
that <i>his head were waters, and his eyes a fountain of tears,
that he might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter
of his people</i>.</p>

<p>11. That you would <i>persevere</i> and <i>continue</i> in the great
trust committed unto you, not deserting, nor neglecting
the duty thereof, for any present discouragements whatsoever;
remembring what out Saviour saith, <i>He that
hath put his hand to the plough, and looketh back, is not fit for
the Kingdome of Heaven</i>.</p>

<p>We cannot deny, but there are many things to dishearten you, and make
you grow faint and weary, <i>viz.</i> your own insufficiency to so
great a work; the untractablenesse, and unperswadeablenesse of many
among the people to submit unto the Government; The small beginnings
of reformation in Church-Government unto which we have yet attained,
and especially the little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">{82}</a></span>
countenance that it finds with many, from whom it
might most justly be expected. Yet notwithstanding,
we hope, that that God which hath stirred you up to
help to lay the first stone in this building, will not suffer
you to leave the work, till the <i>head stone</i> be brought
forth with shoutings, crying, <i>grace, grace unto it</i>. For
this purpose, we desire you earnestly to consider with
us;</p>

<p>1. That the Authority by which you act, is divine. For the office not
only of a teaching, but also of a Ruling Elder, is founded upon the
Word of God, as hath been already shewed.</p>

<p>2. That the Government which you have entred upon,
is not a Government of mans framing, but the Government
of Jesus Christ; who as King and Head of
his Church, hath appointed you your work, and hath
promised, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_106" id="Ref_106" href="#Foot_106">[106]</a></span><i>That
where two or three of you are gathered together
in his name, there to be in the midst of you</i>, to protect,
direct, sanctifie, support, and comfort you. This
Christ is <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_107" id="Ref_107" href="#Foot_107">[107]</a></span><i>that
stone cut out of the mountain without hands,
that will destroy all the Kingdomes that oppose him and his
Government, and will himself become a great mountain, filling
the whole earth</i>. The time is shortly coming, when
the <i>Kingdomes of this world shall become the Kingdoms of
our Lord, and of his Christ</i>; when the <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_108" id="Ref_108" href="#Foot_108">[108]</a></span><i>mountain
of the house of the Lord shall be established in the top of the mountains,
and it shall be axalted above the hills, and people shall flow unto it:
And many Nations shall say, Come and let us go up to the Mountain
of the Lord, and to the house of the God of</i> Jacob, <i>and he will
teach us his wayes, and we will walk in his pathes. And that Nation
and Kingdome, that will not serve the Lord Christ, shall perish
yea those Nations shall be utterly wasted.</i></p>

<p>3. The reward you shall have for the faithfull continuance
in your office, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_109" id="Ref_109" href="#Foot_109">[109]</a></span>is
not from men, (though you deserve,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">{83}</a></span>
and ought to have even from men double honour,
and are to be had in high esteem from your work
sake,) but from God, who hath promised to give you
a <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_110" id="Ref_110" href="#Foot_110">[110]</a></span><i>crown
of glory, that fadeth not away, when the chiefe
Shepherd shall appear</i>; which promise is applicable, not
only to the teaching, but Ruling Elder; the Apostle
speaking there of Elders indefinitely, without restriction
or limitation.</p>

<p>4. The strength by which you act, is the strength of Christ; and
though in your selves you be insufficient for so great a work, (<i>for
who is sufficient for these things</i>) yet <i>by Christ that
strengthens you, you are able to do all things</i>. God never calls a
man to any employment, but he giveth a competent ability thereunto;
and is angry with those that pretend insufficiency for that Office to
which he calls them, as appears by the example of <i>Moses</i>, <i>Exod.</i>
3.10, 11, 13, 14.</p>

<p>5. Consider what great things God hath brought to pass with weak
instruments. <i>Moses</i> a shepherd was the deliverer of the
Israelites out of <i>Egypt</i>; and a great part of the World was
converted by a few Fisher-men. God delights to convey grace by
contemptible Elements; as Water, Bread, and Wine, and to manifest his
great power in mans great weakness, that so all the glory may redound
to him alone.</p>

<p>6. That the greatest undertakings in the Church, have
met with greatest difficulties and oppositions. <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_111" id="Ref_111" href="#Foot_111">[111]</a></span><i>Jerusalem</i>
was built again even in troublous times. <i>Tobia</i> and <i>Sanballat</i>,
and all their Adherents set themselves against it,
both with scorns, false informations, and acts of violence,
yet the work went on and prospered: and though
it had very many years interruption, yet at last God raised
up the spirit of <i>Haggai</i>, <i>Zecheriah</i>, and of <i>Zerubbabel</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">{84}</a></span>
and <i>Joshua</i>, and the work was suddainly finished. <i>Who
art thou O great Mountain before</i> Zerubbabel<i>? thou shalt
become a plain</i>, &amp;c. Oppositions should rather quicken,
then cool activity.</p>

<p>7. That the greatest affairs and achievements are wont at first to
have but small beginnings, like the Prophet <i>Elias</i> cloud. The
repair of the Temple and of the City of <i>Jerusalem</i> was so small
at first, as that the enemies mockt, and said<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_112" id="Ref_112" href="#Foot_112">[112]</a></span>; <i>Even that which they
build, if a Fox go up, he shall break down their stone wall.</i> And
<i>Iudah</i> her self said<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_113" id="Ref_113" href="#Foot_113">[113]</a></span>, <i>The
strength of the bearers of the
burden is decayed, and there is much rubbish, so as we are not able to
build the wall.</i> And yet notwithstanding God saith<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_114" id="Ref_114" href="#Foot_114">[114]</a></span>, <i>Who hath
despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall
see the plummet in the hand of</i> Zerubbabel. <i>The hand of</i>
Zerubbabel <i>laid the foundation of this house, his hand shalt also
finish it, not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the
Lord<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_115" id="Ref_115" href="#Foot_115">[115]</a></span>.</i></p>

<p>8. Consider, <i>who</i>, and of what <i>carriage</i> the most of those
are that oppose this Government, and upon what grounds they are
against it, and it will adde a singular testimony to the goodness of
it, and incourage you the rather to stand for it, seeing so many
erroneous, superstitious, hereticall, leud and licentious persons of
all sorts, are so violent against it.</p>

<p>9. If God countenance the Government, it is the less matter if it want
the countenance of man. Let not the faultinesse of others, discourage
Gods faithfull Ones from their trust and duty: The fewer stand for it,
the more reason there is that we should. <i>The Lord of Hosts is with
us, the God of Jacob is our refuge</i>: And therefore let us not fear
what man can do unto us, for there are more with us, then against us.</p>

<p>10. God hath the hearts of all men in his hands, and
he can in an instant raise up a <i>Cyrus</i> to appear for his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">{85}</a></span>
People, and his Cause; he can raise up <i>Zerubbabels</i>,
<i>Nehemiah's</i>, and <i>Ezrah's</i>; he can, and he will raise up
Kings to be the nursing Fathers, and Queens the nursing
Mothers of his Church; he can turn the hearts of people,
and make them willing to submit their necks to the
yoak of the Lord; and he hath promised, <i>that in the day
of his power, the people shall be willing</i>.</p>

<p>11. Lastly, consider <i>what great things God hath done already for
us</i>; and if he had meant to have destroyed us, he would not have
done all this for us: He hath broken the iron yoak of Prelacy, removed
superstitious Ceremonies, and Service-book, established a more pure
way of Ordination of Ministers, and of worshipping of God, and there
are hopefull beginnings of this Government in many of our
Congregations; and we doubt not, but that God, who hath been the
Author, will be the Finisher of this mighty Work.</p>

<p class="thtbrk">Let the consideration of these particulars exceedingly
affect you, and stir you up to persevere, &amp; hold out in that great
office you have undertaken, in nothing being terrified or discouraged,
but trusting in the great God, who never faileth those that put their
trust in him.</p>

<p class="dropcap-fnt">OUr second Exhortation is unto <i>those of our respective
Congregations, that submit unto the Government, and are admitted unto
the Sacrament of the body and bloud of Christ, in the</i> Presbyterian
way; That we are to exhort you unto, is,</p>

<p>1. That as you are Saints outwardly, and such who
live (as we hope) unblameably in the eyes of the world;
so you would labour to be Saints inwardly, approving
not only your wayes unto men, but your hearts and
consciences unto the heart-searching God. And for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span>
this purpose, we perswade you, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_116" id="Ref_116" href="#Foot_116">[116]</a></span><i>to
wash not only your
hands, but your hearts, from all iniquity, and not to suffer
vain thoughts to lodge within you; To put away the evill of
your doings from before Gods eyes; <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_117" id="Ref_117" href="#Foot_117">[117]</a></span>To
be Jews inwardly circumcised
with the circumcision of the heart, in the</i> Spirit, <i>not
in the</i> Letter, <i>whose praise is not of Man, but of God</i>; To
labour more to be <i>good</i>, then to seem to be <i>good</i>; to be
more ashamed to be <i>evill</i>, then to be known to be <i>evill</i>;
to strive more to get your sins <i>cured</i>, then <i>covered</i>; and
to be not <i>gilded</i>, but <i>golden Christians</i>. Alas! what will
it avail you, to be esteemed by your Minister and Elders
reall Saints, when the Lord who is your Judge,
knows you to be but painted Sepulchres: What will it
profit you to have our <i>Euge</i> and approbation, when you
have the <i>Apage</i> and disallowance of God, and all his
holy Angels? And therefore our prayer to God for you
is, that he would make you not only nominall, but reall
Christians; not only Saints by profession, but by conversation;
not only morally and formally, but Spiritually
and Theologically good, having your persons,
principles, and aims holy, as well as your actions. <i>He
and he only is a right Christian, whose person is united to
Christ by a lively Faith; and whose nature is elevated by
the</i> Spirit of Regeneration, <i>and whose principles, practices,
and aims, are divine and supernatural.</i></p>

<p>Secondly, as it is your great honour and priviledg to
be admitted to the Sacrament, when others by reason
of ignorance or scandal are refused; so it must be your
great care, to come <i>worthily</i>; and so to demean your
selves, that you may be made partakers of the graces &amp;
consolations of this heavenly banquet; And for this
end, we think it our dutie to propound certain necessary
directions to you, for the right ordering of your Sacramental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">{87}</a></span>
approaches; and to perswade you by the
mercies of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the diligent and
conscientious practice of these following particulars.</p>

<p>1. Not to rest contented with the examination of your Minister and
Elders, but chiefly and especially to examine your selves, and so to
eat of that bread, and drink of that cup: To examine your selves,
whether you be in Christ or no, whether You do truly repent; whether
You do hunger and thirst after Christ in the Sacrament; whether You
have an unfeigned love to God, and Your Neighbour, manifested by an
impartial respect unto all the Commandements and Ordinances of Christ:
For though we may and ought to admit you upon the profession of these
graces; yet Christ will not bid You welcome, unless You have them in
truth and sinceritie. And though we cannot discern who are hypocrites,
and who are sincere amongst You; yet he that can distinguish between
star and star, can and will distinguish between a true Saint, and a
formal Hypocrite: and therefore labour to be such, indeed and in
truth, as You seem to Us, to be in <i>word and profession.</i></p>

<p>Secondly, As not to come without preparation and examination; so also
<i>not to trust to your preparation and examination</i>. Sacraments do
not work as Physick, whether men sleep or wake, <i>ex opere
operato</i>, by vertue inherent in them; but <i>ex opere operantis,
according to the disposition and qualification of the party that
partakes of them</i>. If the party be not qualified according to the
tenour of the Covenant of grace, he eats and drinks damnation to
himself, and not salvation; and when he hath done all he can by grace
received, to prepare himself; yet he must not relie upon his
preparation, for this were to make an Idol of it, and set up dutie in
the room of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">{88}</a></span>
Christ. Excellent is that saying of <i>Austine</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_118" id="Ref_118" href="#Foot_118">[118]</a></span>,
<i>He that stands
upon his own strength, shall never stand</i>; and of <i>Bernard</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_119" id="Ref_119" href="#Foot_119">[119]</a></span>,
<i>That man labours in vain, that doth not labour resting upon
Christ and his merits</i>; and therefore we exhort You, after
all your care of preparation, to renounce it as to the
point of confidence, and <i>to come to Christ in the strength
and confidence of Christ alone</i>.</p>

<p>3. Not be satisfied in the bare bringing of the
forementioned graces with you to the Sacrament, but
to labour according to the advice of the Apostle<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_120" id="Ref_120" href="#Foot_120">[120]</a></span>,
<i>to stir up the gift of God that is in you</i>. The Greek is, <i>to blow up</i>,
and cause the grace of God within us to kindle. Fire, as
long as it lyeth raked up in the Embers, will give no
heat; a man may die with cold, for all such a fire.
Grace, as long as it lyeth dead in the habite, will not avail
a man at the Sacrament. And therefore, that you
may be worthy receivers, you must take pains to blow
up the grace of God that is in you. You must arise and
trim your <i>spirituall lamps</i>, (as the <i>wise Virgins</i> did,) that
so you may be fit to meet with your <i>Bridegroom</i>. You
must <i>brighten</i> your <i>spirituall armour</i>, &amp; gird up the loins
of your mind; You must not only have, but put on your
<i>wedding garment</i>, and come to this heavenly feast apparrelled
in all your spiritual ornaments. For it is a certain
truth, that not only a wicked man, that wants grace, but
a childe of God that hath true grace, may receive the
Sacrament unworthily; though he cannot come unworthily
as the wicked do, out of a total want of grace, yet
he may come unworthily out of grosse negligence, and
sinful carelesness, in not exciting and stirring up, and
improving the grace of God that is in him.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_121" id="Ref_121" href="#Foot_121">[121]</a></span>
For not to <i>use grace</i>, and not to <i>have grace</i>, in this case, do little
differ in Gods account. And therefore, if you would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">{89}</a></span>
worthy guests at this Supper, you must not only have a <i>true</i>
Faith, but a <i>fit</i> Faith; not only a true repentance, but a <i>fit</i>
repentance; you must not only have grace, but act grace; you must
set your <i>Faith</i> on work, to feed upon that blessed Sacramentall
promise, <i>Take, eat, this is my body which is broken for you; This
is my blood which is shed for you</i>. And you must labour to make
strong and particular applications of Christ to your souls, and to
believe, that as verily as you eat the Bread, and drink the Wine,
so verily you are made partakers of Christs body and blood, to
your everlasting happiness. And so likewise you must act repentance,
love, thankfullness, and obedience, according to the direction
of the Word of God.</p>

<p>4. <i>To do all that you do at the Sacrament, in remembrance of
Christ.</i> For this is the main design of Christ, in appointing this
Ordinance, that it might be a <i>Love-token</i> from Christ alwaies by
us, and an effectual means to keep his death in perpetual remembrance,
that it might be a lively picture of Christ crucified; and
he that will receive aright, must be eying this Picture while he is
at the Sacrament; and the more he minds it, the more he will
admire it: The Angels<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_122" id="Ref_122" href="#Foot_122">[122]</a></span>
<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_123" id="Ref_123" href="#Foot_123">[123]</a></span><i>stoop
down</i> to <i>look</i> upon Christ incarnate,
and it is the happiness of heaven to have Christ alwaies before
them; and it is our happiness on earth, that we have such a blessed
commemoration of Christ crucified: As Christ is all in all, in
all Creatures, in all Relations, in all Conditions, and in all
Ordinances; so more especially in this: For the Elements of Bread
and Wine are not appointed for natural ends and purposes, but
Christ is all in all in them: They are Representations, Commemorations,
Obsignations, and Exhibitions of Jesus Christ. You
must labour with the Eye of Faith to see Christs name written
upon the Bread and Wine, and you must read Christ in every
Sacramental action: when You behold the Bread and Wine
consecrated; You must remember how Jesus Christ was set apart
by his Father, from all Eternity, to be the Redeemer of his People:
And when the Minister breaks the bread, You must remember
the great sufferings that Jesus Christ endured for Your sins;
and when You take the Bread, and drink the Wine, you must do
this in remembrance of Christ; You must believe, that now Christ
giveth himself to be Your nourishment, and your Comforter unto
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
eternal life; and you must labour by a lively Faith,
to take him as your Lord and Saviour, and to cry out
with <i>Thomas</i> in the highest degree (if it be possible) of
rejoycing, <i>My God, and my Lord</i>: <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_124" id="Ref_124" href="#Foot_124">[124]</a></span>And when you eat
the Bread, and drink the Wine, you must remember,
that Christ <i>is the living Bread that came down from Heaven,
and that whosoever eats of this Bread, shall live for
ever: and that whosoever eateth the flesh of Christ, and
drinketh his blood, dwelleth in Christ, and Christ in him</i>.
And you must endeavour to receive Soul-nourishment
from Christ, as your bodies do by the bread you eat;
and as the bread is turned into your substance, so to be
made more and more one with Christ by faith: that having
a reall, though spirituall union with him, You may
have a happy interest and communion in all his purchases.
This is the life of the <i>Holy Sacrament</i>, without
which, all is but a dead and empty Ceremonie. But we
adde further, That this remembrance of Christ must
not be barely <i>notionall</i>, <i>doctrinall</i>, and <i>historicall</i>, but it
must be also <i>practicall</i>, <i>experimentall</i>, and <i>applicative</i>; it
must produce these and such like blessed effects and
operations in your hearts.</p>

<p>1. You must so remember Christ, as to find power coming out of Christ
Sacramental, to break your hearts for all the sins you have committed
against him. Christ is presented in the Sacrament as a broken Christ;
his body broken, and his bloud poured out: and the very breaking of
the bread understandingly looked upon, is a forcible argument to break
your hearts. Was Jesus Christ rent and torn in pieces for you, and
shall it not break you hearts, that you should sin against him? Was he
crucified for you, and will you crucifie him by your sins? And
besides, the breaking of the bread is not only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">{91}</a></span>
ordained to be a motive unto brokenness of heart for
sin, but also in the right use to effect that which it doth
move unto.</p>

<p>2. You must so remember Christ Sacramentall, as to find power coming
out of Christ, to subdue all your sins and iniquities; as the diseased
woman felt vertue coming out of Christ, to cure her bloody Issue; so
there is power in an <i>applicative and fiduciall remembrance</i> of
Christ at the Sacrament, to heal all the sinfull issues of our souls.
There is no sin so strong, but it is conquerable by a power derived
from Christ crucified.</p>

<p>3. This is to remember Christ aright at the Sacrament,
when you never cease remembring him, till your
hearts be brought into a thankfull frame to God, for
Christ and for his ineffable blessings and mercies exhibited
in the Sacrament to a worthy receiver. And
therefore it is called an <i>Eucharist</i>, or a feast of thanksgiving.
It is as <i>Justin Martyr</i> saith, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_125" id="Ref_125" href="#Foot_125">[125]</a></span><i>food
made up all of thanksgiving</i>. It is a custome in Colledges and houses
founded by the bounty of great men, to have a <i>feastivall
commemoration</i> of the bounties of their Benefactors.
The Sacrament is a <i>commemoration day</i> of your great Benefactor
Iesus Christ, wherein you are to remember all
those things which he suffered for you; and the proper
duty of the day is <i>thanksgiving</i>.</p>

<p>4. You must not leave off remembring Christ Sacramental, till your
hearts be inflamed with an ardent love to Jesus Christ; for he is set
forth in this Sacrament, in all the endearing expressions, as a
crucified Christ, as pouring out his blood for us. Now it is an
excellent expression of <i>Bernard</i>: <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_126" id="Ref_126" href="#Foot_126">[126]</a></span><i>The
more vile Christ made himself
for us, the more dear he ought to be unto us.</i> You must never leave
meditating of his love, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_127" id="Ref_127" href="#Foot_127">[127]</a></span><i>till
he be as fast fixed in your hearts, as he was upon the Cross</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">{92}</a></span>
5. You must so remember Christ, as to be willing
to do and suffer any thing for that Christ, that hath
done and suffered so much for you; till you can say
with <i>David</i>, <i>What shall I render for all his blessings towards
me?</i> till you can say with <i>Thomas</i>, <i>Come, let us go dye
with him</i>; and we add, <i>for him</i>: till with the Apostle,
you can rejoyce to be <i>counted worthy to be whipt for his
names sake</i>. And can with <i>Ignatius</i> that blessed Martyr,
<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_128" id="Ref_128" href="#Foot_128">[128]</a></span>call
your iron chains, not <i>bonds</i>, but <i>Ornaments</i>, and <i>Spirituall
Pearls</i>; till you can say, as <i>Judg.</i> 8.22. <i>Rule thou
over us</i>, &amp;c. <i>for thou hast delivered us from the hand of
Midian</i>. There is nothing hard to that Christian, that
doth rightly remember Christ Sacramental.</p>

<p>6. You must continue in remembring Christ in the Sacrament, till your
hearts be wrought up to a <i>through contempt of the world, and all
worldly things</i>. Christ instituted the Sacrament when he was going
out of the world; and when he was crucifying, the whole world was in
darkness and obscurity: and he is propounded in the Sacrament, as a
<i>persecuted, broken, crucified Christ, despising, &amp; being despised
of the world</i>. And if you do practically remember the Sacrament of
his death, you will finde vertue coming out thereof, to make you dead
to the world, and all worldly things. The Sacrament is called by the
Ancients, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_129" id="Ref_129" href="#Foot_129">[129]</a></span><i>a
feast for Eagles, not for Dawes</i>; and therefore it
was a phrase ordinarily used in the administration of this Sacrament,
<i>Lift up your hearts to heaven where Christ is</i>.</p>

<p>7. Cease not remembring Christ, till you be made partakers of the rare
grace of <i>humility</i>. Of all the graces that Christ picks out, in
which he would have Christians to imitate him in, <i>humility</i> is
one of the chiefest, <i>Matth.</i> 11.29. <i>Learn of me, for I am
humble</i>, &amp;c. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">{93}</a></span>
Christ in the Sacrament is presented, as <i>humbling himself</i> to the
death of the Cross, for our sakes. And what a shame is it, to
remember an humble Christ, with a proud heart? The practicall
remembrance of the humility of <i>Christ Sacramental</i>, when sanctified,
is mighty in operation, to tame the pride of our hearts.</p>

<p>8. You must not fail to remember Christ in the Sacrament,
till by faith you have <i>applyed Christ, as your Christ</i>: Till you can
say with <i>Paul</i>, <i>Gal.</i> 2.20. <i>Who loved me, and gave himself
for me.</i> Propriety in Christ, is that which sweetens all. For
what are you the better <i>for Christ</i>, if he be not your <i>Christ</i>?
The Divels and damned in Hell may remember Christ, but not
with comfort, because they cannot remember him, but as their
enemy. But you must so remember Christ, as to make him yours,
by an <i>appropriating Faith</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Quest.</div>

<p>But how shall we be inabled thus to apply Christ?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></div>

<p>This is done, by studying the free tender that is made of Christ in
the Covenant of grace, which is expressed, <i>Isai.</i> 55.1.
<i>Revel.</i> 22.17. Jesus Christ is that brazen Serpent lifted up
upon the Cross, on purpose, that whosoever looks up to him, shall be
healed; and whosoever receives him as his Lord and Saviour, <i>should
not perish, but have everlasting life</i>. You must study the
<i>freeness</i>, <i>fulness</i>, and <i>particularity</i> of the offer
of Christ; and pray unto that Christ, who bids you believe, to give
you to believe. And truly there cannot be a greater discourtesie to
Jesus Christ, then to doubt of his love towards you, while ye are
receiving the pledges of his love. For herein hath <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_130" id="Ref_130" href="#Foot_130">[130]</a></span><i>God commended
his love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ dyed for
us</i>. What can Christ do more to manifest his love, or to perswade
us of his love he bears to us? Much more might be said to this
purpose, but we leave these things to be amplified by the Ministry of
your faithful Pastors. And we proceed to give you further directions,
for the right managing of your Sacramental addresses.</p>

<p>5. In the fifth place, we exhort you to consider the Sacrament, under
a four-fold Notion:</p>

<p>1. As it is a <i>spirituall medicine</i> to cure the remainders of your
corruption.</p>

<p>2. As it is <i>spirituall food</i> to strengthen your weak graces.</p>

<p>3. As it is a <i>spiritual Cordial</i> to comfort your distressed consciences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">{94}</a></span>
4. As it is a <i>strong obligation</i> and forcible engagement to all
acts of thankfulness and obedience unto Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Now if you would get the benefit and comfort of the Sacrament, you
must when you come to it, carry these four considerations in your
mind; and labour to draw out good from the Sacrament, according to
each of them.</p>

<p>1. You must consider what sin it is, that is most unsubdued, and
unmortified in you; you must use the Sacrament as a <i>medicine</i>
made of Christs body and blood, to heal that sin.</p>

<p>2. You must consider, what <i>grace</i> is most weak in you; and you
must come to the Sacrament, as to food appointed on purpose to
strengthen weak grace.</p>

<p>3. You must consider what <i>doubt</i> it is, that doth most obstruct
your full assurance of salvation; and you must come to the Sacrament,
as to a cheering Cordial, made for this very end, to revive your
fainting spirit. It is also a <i>sealing Ordinance</i> to seal up the
love of God in Christ, and to be as a <i>golden clasp</i> to fasten
you to Christ, and Christ to you: And in which Christ doth often go
from man to man, with his <i>privy seals</i>, and his <i>hidden
manna</i> of heavenly consolation.</p>

<p>4. You must consider how apt you are to start from God, and his just
Commands, and therefore you must at the Sacrament <i>renew your
Covenant</i> with <span class="smcap">God</span>, and binde your selves afresh unto
<span class="smcap">God</span>, in the strength of Christ, to be his more faithful
servants afterwards, then ever you were before.</p>

<p>And hereby likewise you may know when you come from the Sacrament,
whether you have received worthily, or no: For if you finde these
Effects from the Sacrament,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">{95}</a></span>
that it hath been <i>Medicinall, corroborative, comforting,
and obliging</i>: If you find your sins more mortified,
your graces more strengthened, your souls more
comforted, and your hearts more engaged unto God in
obedience; You may certainly conclude, that you are
worthy Receivers. Nay we adde, for the comfort of
<i>weak Christians</i>, if you find any one of these Effects. For
sometimes Christ lets out himself in the Sacrament in a
way of <i>Comfort</i>; sometimes he hides, as it were, his face,
and sends us home more <i>inlarged</i> in our <i>desires</i> after
him; sometimes he <i>kisses his children with the kisses of
his lips</i>, and gives them to eat of his <i>hidden Manna</i>; sometimes
he sends them home inlarged with <i>godly sorrow</i>,
for want of his imbraces. His dispensations are various.
But if you finde his presence in any one of these
waies, You are worthy Communicants.</p>

<p>6. To endeavour, that your <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_131" id="Ref_131" href="#Foot_131">[131]</a></span><i>eyes
may affect your hearts</i>, when
you are at the Sacrament. For as Christ in the Ministery of his Word,
preacheth to the ear; and by the ear conveyeth himself into the heart:
so in the Sacrament he preacheth to the eye; and by the eye, conveyeth
himself into the heart. And therefore it is well called a <i>visible
Sermon</i>. Take heed, lest the Devil steal away the benefit &amp; comfort
of it out of your hearts, by a wanton or wandring eye. And when you
find your hearts deaded, and your meditations begin to flag and grow
dry, fasten your eyes upon the Sacramental Elements, and Sacramental
actions. Consider the bread broken, and the wine poured forth, and
<i>let your eye affect your heart</i>; and never leave looking upon
them, till Christ be pleased to look upon you, as he did upon
<i>Peter</i>, and then your hearts will be affected indeed, as his was.</p>

<p>7. To take heed of passing <i>rash censures</i> upon those that are
admitted to the Sacrament, together with your selves; say not such a
man is unworthy, but say rather with the Centurion, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_132" id="Ref_132" href="#Foot_132">[132]</a></span><i>Lord
I am not worthy that thou shouldst enter under my roof, wherefore neither
thought I myself worthy to come unto thee</i>; say as <i>John</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">{96}</a></span>
<i>Baptist</i> of Christ, <i>I am not worthy to untye thy shooe-latchet</i>,
much lesse to sit with thee at thy table; say not that such a one
is a Dog, and not fit to eat childrens bread, but say rather of thy
self, as <i>Mephibosheth</i> doth, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_133" id="Ref_133" href="#Foot_133">[133]</a></span><i>What
am I? that thou shouldest look
upon such a dead dog</i>, &amp;c. The nature of man is very apt (as one
saith) <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_134" id="Ref_134" href="#Foot_134">[134]</a></span><i>to
use spectacles, rather then looking-glasses</i>; spectacles, to
behold other mens faults, rather then looking-glasses to behold
our own. But we hope better things of you. Remember, that
when the Disciples were at the Passeover with Christ, and Christ
told them, that one of them should betray him; They did not
passe harsh sentences one upon another, but every one suspected
himself, rather then his fellow-Apostle, and said, <i>Master, Is it I?</i>
Be not offended at thy brothers wickednesse, which thou art not
sure on, but at thine own unthankfulnesse, which thou art sure is
very great.</p>

<p>8. When you are gone from the Sacrament, you must labour to walk in
the <i>strength of that food</i>, (as <i>Elias</i> did of his) <i>till you come
to the mount of God</i>. As you have been made partakers of an
Ordinance, to which others are not admitted, so you must endeavour to
live more self-denyingly, more heavenly mindedly, more holily and
righteously, then they do, that are not admitted. <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_135" id="Ref_135" href="#Foot_135">[135]</a></span><i>You
must love your enemies; blesse them that curse you; do good to them that hate
you, and pray for them that do despitefully use you, and persecute
you. For if you love them that love you, what reward have you? Do not
even the Publicanes the same? And if you salute your Brethren only,
what do ye more then others? Do not even the Publicanes so?</i> You
are admitted to an Ordinance, that is not common to all, but peculiar
to Saints, and therefore your lives must have something peculiar in
them, which no wicked man can have. You must believe and repent after
such a manner, as no <i>Reprobate</i> can do; You must pray in your
families with more life and zeal then others; you must be more just &amp;
faithful in your dealings then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">{97}</a></span>
others; and have more faith, and hope, and love to
God. In a word, You must so carry and demean your
selves in all your words and actions, as that you may
be a credit and an ornament, and not a scandal to the
Congregation, of which you are members. <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_136" id="Ref_136" href="#Foot_136">[136]</a></span><i>Walking
worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being faithfull unto
every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God:
Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power,
unto all patience and long-suffering with joyfulnesse</i>. And
this we pray<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_137" id="Ref_137" href="#Foot_137">[137]</a></span>,
<i>That your love may abound yet more and more,
in knowledge, and in all judgment: That ye may approve
the things that are excellent, that ye may be sincere and without
offence till the day of Christ: Being filled with the fruits
of Righteousnesse, which are by Jesus Christ unto the glory
and praise of God</i>.</p>

<p>We have been larger, then we thought, in these particulars about the
Sacrament, out of a holy jealousie which we have over you, (which we
doubt not but you will pardon in us) fearing lest after your first
admission to this Ordinance, you should grow remiss and careless,
satisfying your consciences with the naked approbation that your
Minister and Elders give of your knowledg and conversation; and in the
mean time, neglecting to get the benefit and comfort of this
Ordinance, and to thrive, and increase in knowledg and holiness
proportionably to the expectation of God, and your godly officers.</p>

<p>We shall be briefer in what we have further to say unto you.</p>

<p>3. In the third place we exhort you, to <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_138" id="Ref_138" href="#Foot_138">[138]</a></span><i>Obey
those that rule over you, and submit your selves, for they, watch for your soules, as they
that must give an account, that they may do it with joy, and not with
grief; for that is unprofitable</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>
<i>for you</i>. <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_139" id="Ref_139" href="#Foot_139">[139]</a></span><i>And
we beseech you, Brethren, know them
which labour amongst you, and are over you in the Lord,
and admonish you, and esteem them very highly in love for
their works sake, and be at peace amongst your selves.</i> And
remember, <span class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_140" id="Ref_140" href="#Foot_140">[140]</a></span><i>That
the Elders that rule well, are worthy of
double honour, especially they that labour in the Word and
Doctrine</i>. For the Scripture saith, <i>Thou shalt not muzzel
the oxe that treadeth out the corn</i>, and <i>the labourer is worthy
of his reward</i>. And it likewise saith, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_141" id="Ref_141" href="#Foot_141">[141]</a></span><i>Let him that is
taught in the word, communicate unto him that teacheth in
all good things</i>. And further, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_142" id="Ref_142" href="#Foot_142">[142]</a></span><i>Do
ye not know, that they which minister about holy things, live of the things of the
Temple; and they which wait at the Altar, are partakers
with the Altar? Even so hath the Lord ordained, that they
which preach the Gospell, should live of the Gospel.----If
we have sowen unto you spirituall things, is it a great matter,
if we reap your carnal things?</i> This we write, not to
shame you, but to intreat you to give liberall and honourable
maintenance to your godly Ministers, that
they may not only be <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_143" id="Ref_143" href="#Foot_143">[143]</a></span><i>lovers
of hospitality</i>, but also inabled
to exercise it: lest God in anger to you, drive your
Ministers into corners, and take both your estates, and
your Ministers from you; so as you shall neither have
Ministers to give maintenance to, nor estates to maintain
Ministers.</p>

<p>4. To perform all those offices which are required of you, as you are
Members of a particular Congregation. For this purpose we exhort you
brethren, to <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_144" id="Ref_144" href="#Foot_144">[144]</a></span><i>comfort
your selves together, and edifie one another,
even as you also do; to warn them that are unruly, comfort the feeble
minded, support the weak, be patient towards all men: And see that
none render evill for evill unto any man, but ever follow that which
is good, both among your selves, and towards all men, &amp;c. <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_145" id="Ref_145" href="#Foot_145">[145]</a></span>Let the Word
of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdome, teaching and
admonishing one another in</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">{99}</a></span>
<i>Psalms and Hymnes, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in
your hearts to the Lord. <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_146" id="Ref_146" href="#Foot_146">[146]</a></span>Let
no man seek his own, but every
man anothers wealth; and <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_147" id="Ref_147" href="#Foot_147">[147]</a></span>let
every one of you please his
neighbour for his good, to edification; for even Christ pleased
not himself; but as it is written, The reproaches of them
that reproached thee, fell on me. <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_148" id="Ref_148" href="#Foot_148">[148]</a></span>Let
nothing be done through
strife, or vain-glory; but in lowliness of minde, let each
esteem other better then themselves.</i> Now though we are
far from thinking, (as some do,) that you are bound to
perform these duties only to those to whom you are
united in Church-fellowship, (for if you ought to pluck
your neighbours ox and horse out of a ditch, and to relieve
his body, when in want, though not of the same
Congregation with you, much more ought you to extend
acts of spirituall mercy (such as these are) to their
souls; and this you are bound unto by communion of
natures, communion of Saints, communion of
Churches; and by that Royal law of love, which commands
us to love our neighbour as our selves,) yet notwithstanding
we conceive that you are more especially
tyed by your Congregational relation, to perform
these duties to those that are of your own Communion.</p>

<p>And therefore we further perswade you, <i>to watch over one another,
to bear the burdens one of another, and so fulfill the Law of Christ.
To consider one another, to provoke unto love and good works, not
forsaking the assembling of your selves together, as the manner of
some is, but exhorting one another, and so much the more, as you see
the day approaching</i>. And we likewise desire you not to neglect
private meetings together for holy conference and prayer; that hereby
you may be better acquainted one with another, and be mutual helps one
to another in spirituall things.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">{100}</a></span>
We think that speech of <i>Cain</i> unbefitting the mouth of
any Christian; <i>Am I my brothers keeper?</i> And though
we believe, that none ought to take the Office of a Minister,
but he that is elected and ordained thereunto, yet
we believe also, <i>that it is the duty of all private Christians,
in a brotherly way, out of the common bond of charity, to build
up one another in their most holy Faith</i>. And therefore let
those <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_149" id="Ref_149" href="#Foot_149">[149]</a></span><i>that
fear the Lord, speak often one to another</i>, especially
in these evil daies: <i>and strive together for the Faith
of the Gospel, standing fast in one spirit with one mind</i>. For
it seemeth to us to be very unchristian, that they especially,
that have chosen one and the same Minister, and
wait constantly upon his Ministry, and that break bread
together, should live together like Heathens and Publicanes:
at as great a strangeness one from another, as if
they lived many miles asunder. And that Drunkards
and Adulterers should meet together to dishonor God,
and to encourage one another in wickednesse; and you
should not assemble your selves together, to honour
God, to strengthen and edifie one another, and to confirm
one another in the truth. Only be careful in your
meetings, to take heed of <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_150" id="Ref_150" href="#Foot_150">[150]</a></span><i>doting
about questions, and strifes
of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railing, evill surmises,
perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute
of the truth</i>. And <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_151" id="Ref_151" href="#Foot_151">[151]</a></span><i>avoid
all foolish and unlearned Questions,
for they are vain and unprofitable, and gender nothing
but strife</i>; But help one another in that <i>one thing necessary</i>,
how to <i>grow up in Christ</i>; how to <i>make your calling
and election sure</i>; how to <i>thrive under Ordinances</i>; to be
<i>faithfull under Relations</i>, to adorn the Gospel you profess;
how to advance the power of godliness in your
several spheres; and to be more spiritually serviceable
unto God in your generations, and such like.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">{101}</a></span>
And we further exhort you, that if any Brother in
the Congregation walk <i>disorderly</i> and <i>scandalously</i>, that
you would carefully remember, It is your duty, first, <i>to
tell him privately</i>; (and not to tell it to Others, to his
and the Churches disgrace, as the manner of some is,)
The text is plain, <i>Go and tell him his fault betwixt him and
thee alone</i>; and if he shall hear thee, thou <i>hast gained thy
Brother</i>. But if he will not hear thee, <i>then take with thee
one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses,
every word may be established</i>. And if he shall neglect to
hear them, <i>tell it to the Church</i>. And consider, we beseech
you, that the most part of Sacramental reformation,
begins with your performing of this dutie. For how
can the Elders judicially take notice of any scandall, till
it be brought unto them, in the way of Christ, by you
that are Church-Members? There is great complaint
amongst well-affected people, of <i>Sacramental pollutions</i>;
and many thereupon, though groundlesly, separate
from our Congregations. But if things were rightly
considered, it would appear, that the people themselves
are the chief causes of this pollution; for you are the
<i>first wheel</i> of this part of reformation, and if you neglect
your part, how can we discharge ours? And therefore
we intreat you, even for Christs sake, as ever you desire
to keep your selves pure from the sin of those that receive
unworthily, and from being Authors of the prophanation
of the Sacrament, faithfully to discharge this
your dutie. And we shall (by the help of God) be exactly
careful of ours, that so the Lord may delight to
dwell in the midst of us.</p>

<p>5. <i>To labour to keep your selves free from the Errours, Heresies,
and Blasphemies of these Times.</i> For it is evident to every
impartial Observer, that false teachers, evil men,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">{102}</a></span>
and seducers are gone abroad amongst us; subverting
of Souls and overthrowing the Faith of some; speaking
perverse things, to draw away disciples after them; subverting
whole Housholds, teaching things they ought
not for filthy lucres sake; creeping into houses, and
leading captive silly women, laden with divers lusts;
and by good words, and fair speeches, deceiving the
hearts of the simple; yea, by slight and cunning craftiness,
lying in wait to deceive (if it were possible) the very
Elect; and not only privily; but now openly and avowedly
bringing in damnable Heresies, denying the Lord that bought
them. The <i>Divine Authority</i> of the Scriptures is oppugned,
the <i>Deity of Christ opposed</i>, and his <i>Holy Spirit</i> blasphemed,
the Doctrine of the <i>Blessed Trinity</i> questioned,
the <i>Holy God</i> made the <i>Author of sin</i> and sinfulnesse,
<i>Universall Redemption</i> preached, and the ends of Christs
death evacuated, <i>Free-will</i> by nature to do <i>good</i> maintained,
the <i>mortallity</i> of the <i>Soul</i> affirmed; the <i>Use of the
Morall Law of God</i>, the <i>Observation of the Christian Sabbath</i>,
the <i>very calling and Function of the Ministry</i>, the <i>very
being of a Church</i> amongst Us, and all <i>the Ordinances
of Christ</i>, are slighted and rejected. These, and too many
more such <i>monstrous Opinions</i> in the very spring-time
of <i>Reformation</i> do so multiply amongst vs, that the <i>tares</i>
are like to <i>overgrow the Wheat</i>, if God prevent not. And
that which aggravates the evil of these things is, That
<i>London</i> should be guilty of such <i>Apostacy</i> from the truth.
<i>London</i>! which hast had able and faithful Ministers of
the Word preaching to thee; that hast been so miraculously
preserved from the Sword, Famine, and Pestilence
these last Years, yet have Heresies been hatched
and nourished up under <i>thy wings</i>; and from thee have
they been spread all the Kingdom over. How many in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">{103}</a></span>
this City have turned away their ears from the truth,
faithfully preached by their <i>Pastors</i>; and being turned
unto fables, have already followed the pernicious waies
of Seducers, whereby the way of truth is evil spoken
on! How is <i>Religion degenerated</i> into vain janglings, and
the <i>power of Godlinesse</i> eaten up by perverse disputings!
And that which should fill Us with more grief and
astonishment is, That this inundation of Errours and
Heresies hath increased upon Us, after such <i>prayers</i>,
<i>preachings</i>, <i>disputes</i>, and <i>testimonies</i> against them; after a
<i>Covenant</i> solemnly sworn to <i>God</i>, with hands lifted up
to heaven, for the extirpation of them; and after a solemn
Fast commanded by Authority, and observed
throughout the whole <i>Kingdom</i>, for our humiliation for
them. And yet (with grief of heart we mention it) those
Errours which in the Prelates time were but a few, are
now many: Those that of late crept into corners, now
out-face the Sun: Those which the <i>Godly</i> abhor'd from
their hearts, are now vented as <i>new and glorious truths</i>:
Nay, to such a degree of <i>Apostacie</i> are some arrived, being
waxen worse and worse, that they are labouring for
an <i>odious tolleration</i> of all those <i>abominable opinions</i>, as can
shroud themselves under the name of Christian Religion.</p>

<p>Wherefore, in the Name of Jesus Christ, we warn
you all to take heed of these <i>Impostors</i> and <i>Seducers</i>; and
to keep close to those <i>good</i> and <i>old</i> principles of Christianitie,
which you have suck't in at <i>your first conversion,
out of the Word</i>, from your godly Ministers: And seeing
ye know these things before, <i>beware lest you also being led
away with the errour of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastnesse;
But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our
Lord and Saviour</i> Jesus Christ; <i>to him be glory, both now</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
<i>and for ever</i>, Amen. Oh how happy were it, if it might
be said of all You that submit to the Presbyterian Government;
as once of the <i>Godly</i> in <i>Sardis</i>. <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_152" id="Ref_152" href="#Foot_152">[152]</a></span><i>There are a few
names even in</i> London, <i>that have not defiled their Garments,
and they shall walk with me in white, for they are
worthy.</i> Which that you may the better be inabled to
do, We beseech You Brethren, in the words of the Apostle,
<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_153" id="Ref_153" href="#Foot_153">[153]</a></span><i>To
mark them which cause divisions and offences,
contrary to the Doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid
them, for they that are such, serve not our Lord</i> Jesus
Christ, <i>but their own belly</i>. Observe here, that you are
not only required to avoid their <i>Doctrines</i>, but their <i>persons</i>.
And so likewise the same Apostle, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_154" id="Ref_154" href="#Foot_154">[154]</a></span><i>If any man teach
otherwise, and consent not to wholsome words, even the words
of our Lord</i> Jesus Christ, <i>and to the Doctrine which is according
to Godlinesse, he is proud, knowing nothing</i>, &amp;c.
<i>From such withdraw thyself.</i> It is your dutie, not onely
to keep your selves from the Heresies of these times;
but, that you may be preserved from the Heresies, you
must keep your selves, and all under your charge, from
such as spread them, and from their meeting-places. For
he that without a just cause goeth into a <i>Pesthouse</i>, may thank
himself, if he get the plague. And he that runs headily
into temptation, <i>hath no promise from God to be delivered
out</i>. The Apostle <i>John</i> refused to tarry in the same <i>Bath
with Cerinthus</i>; and he commands us in his second Epistle,
<i>If there come any unto you, and bring not this Doctrine,
receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed;
for he that biddeth him God-speed, is partaker of his evil
deeds.</i></p>

<p>Take heed how you touch pitch, lest you be defiled; And remember, we
have faithfully discharged our consciences to you, in this particular;
And that you may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">{105}</a></span>
be farther instructed against the Errors and Heresies of
these times, We will propound a few <i>Antidotes</i> and <i>Preservatives</i>
unto you, under these general Rules following.</p>

<p>1. Whatsoever Doctrine is <i>contrary to Godlinesse</i>, and
opens a door to Libertinism and Prophaneness, you
must reject it as <i>Soul-poyson</i>. Such are Doctrines against
the <i>Sabbath</i>, <i>Family-duties</i>, and <i>publique Ordinances</i>: Such
is the Doctrine of an <i>Universall tolleration</i> of all Religions.
The Doctrine of the Gospel, is a Doctrine <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_155" id="Ref_155" href="#Foot_155">[155]</a></span><i>according
to Godliness</i>; It is a <i>Mysterie of Godliness</i>; <i>It teacheth
to deny all ungodlinesse and worldly lusts, and to live soberly,
righteously, and godly in this present world</i>.</p>

<p>2. You must reject all such Doctrines, as hold forth
a <i>strictnesse above what is written</i>. Papists teach many
strict Doctrines, of self-whippings, and voluntary povertie,
vows of continency, and many such like; but the
Apostle gives you an <i>Antidote</i> against them, <i>Col.</i> 2.18,
19, 20, 21, 22, 23. And so also our blessed Saviour,
<i>Matth.</i> 15.1. to the 10. Devout people are much taken
with Doctrines that carry a shew of strictness, and of
much purity; but you must not be wise above what is
written; You must be <i>Candidates</i> of a <i>Canonicall</i>, not an
<i>Apocryphal</i> strictness; And therefore when you are
taught, that whosoever will enter into <i>Church-fellowship</i>,
must first take a <i>Church-Covenant</i>; and that whosoever
will be admitted unto the <i>Lords Supper</i>, must not only
be free from ignorance and scandal, but he must have
other, and more strict qualifications; you must enquire
what word they have for these assertions; and where
<i>God hath not a mouth to speak, you must not have an ear to
hear, nor an heart to believe</i>.</p>

<p>3. Whatsoever Doctrine tendeth to the <i>lifting up of</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">{106}</a></span>
<i>nature corrupted</i>, to the <i>exalting of unsanctified Reason</i>, and
giveth <i>free will in supernaturall things to a man unconverted,
is a Doctrine contrary to the Gospell</i>. For this is one
chief aym of <i>Pauls</i> Epistles, to shew, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_156" id="Ref_156" href="#Foot_156">[156]</a></span><i>That
by nature we are dead in sins and trespasses, and that the naturall man receiveth
not the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolishnesse
unto him; neither can he know them, because they
are spiritually discerned</i>, and that <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_157" id="Ref_157" href="#Foot_157">[157]</a></span><i>the
carnall mind is enmity
against God, for it is not subject to the Law of God, neither
indeed can be</i>. This Rule will preserve you against all
<i>Arminian Tenets</i>. For this is the main difference between
the Doctrine of the Gospel, and the Arminians.
The Gospel makes <i>free grace</i> put the distinction between
the Elect and Reprobate; and the Arminians
<i>Free-will</i>.</p>

<p>4. All Doctrines that set up our own Righteousness, whether of <i>Morality</i>,
or <i>Sanctification</i>, in the room of Christs Righteousness; That place
good works in the throne of Christ, are Doctrines of Antichrist, and
not of Christ. For the Gospel teacheth us, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_158" id="Ref_158" href="#Foot_158">[158]</a></span>that
all our best works are
imperfect, and that we are justified, not by our own inherent
Righteousness, but by the Righteousness of Christ only, made ours by
Faith: this Rule will keep you from much of the <i>poyson of Popery</i>.</p>

<p>5. All Doctrines that do set up Christ and his Righteousness, as to
decry all works of Sanctification, and to deny them to be fruits and
evidences of our justification, are to be avoided and abhorred. For
<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_159" id="Ref_159" href="#Foot_159">[159]</a></span>the
Scripture makes sanctification an evidence of Justification,
and commandeth all Believers to maintain good works. This Rule will
preserve you against most of the Errors of the Antinomians.</p>

<p>6. That Doctrine <i>that lesseneth the priviledges of Believers</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">{107}</a></span>
<i>under the New Testament, and maketh their Infants
in a worse condition, then they were in under the Old Testament,
cannot be the Doctrine of the Gospel</i>. For the Gospel
tells you, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_160" id="Ref_160" href="#Foot_160">[160]</a></span>that
Jesus Christ was made a Surety of a better
Testament, and that the new Covenant is a better
Covenant; established upon better promises. This
Rule will preserve you from the poyson of Anabaptism.
For if the children of the Jews were circumcised,
and the children of Christians should not be baptized,
either it must be granted, that circumcision was of no
benefit to the Jewish children, which is contrary to
<i>Rom.</i> 3.1, 2. or it must be granted, that the children of the
Jews had greater priviledges then the children of Christians.</p>

<p>7. That Doctrine that cryeth up <i>Purity to the ruine of
Unity, is contrary to the Doctrine of the Gospel</i>. For the
Gospel calleth for unity, as well as purity, 1&nbsp;<i>Cor.</i> 1.10.
<i>Phil.</i> 2.1, 2. <i>Eph.</i> 4.3, 4, 5, 6. And Christ prayed for the
unity of his Church, as well as the Holiness, <i>Joh.</i> 17.21,
22. and it is prophesied of the times of the Gospel,
That in those daies, God will give his people, <i>one heart,
and one way, and to serve him with one consent</i>, <i>Jer.</i> 32.29.
<i>Zeph.</i> 3.9. This Rule will teach you what to judg of the
Congregational-way: For certainly that Government
that carrieth in the front of it <i>A tolleration of different
Religions</i>, and is not sufficient to keep the body of
Christ in unity and purity, is not the Government of
Christ.</p>

<p>8. Whatsoever Doctrine is contrary to the Rule of Faith, or to any
duty required in the ten Commandements, or to any Petition of the
Lords prayer, is not a Doctrine of Christ, and therefore to be
rejected.</p>

<p>We might add many more Rules, but we forbear,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">{108}</a></span>
lest we should be over-tedious. Our prayer to God for
you is, That you may be fix't, not falling Stars, in the
Firmament of his Church; <i>Not children tossed to and fro,
and carried about with every wind of Doctrine</i>; Not Reeds
shaken with every wind, but firm Pillars in his house.
Wherefore, Beloved Brethren, <i>Stand fast and immoveable,
alwayes abounding in the Work of the Lord; Forasmuch
as you know, that your labour is not in vain in the
Lord</i>.</p>

<p>But now, because he that would keep himself from
the Errour of the times, must also keep himself from the
sins of the times: (For it is sin that makes God give us
up to errour, 2&nbsp;<i>Thess.</i> 2.10, 11. and it is sin that makes a
man like a <i>piece of wax</i>, ready to receive the impression
of any errour. The women in <i>Timothie</i> were first laden
with divers lusts, before they were led away captive to
divers errours; and whosoever puts away a good confidence,
will quickly <i>concerning Faith make ship wrack</i>,
as we are told, 1&nbsp;<i>Tim.</i> 1.19.) Therefore we are necessitated
to inlarge our Exhortation to you in one particular
more; which though it be the last, yet it is not the
least of those things which we have to say unto you, and
that is,</p>

<p>6. To exhort you, or rather to require and charge
you, <i>to keep your selves unspotted</i>, not only from the errors
and heresies, (as before) but also <i>from the sins and iniquities
of the times wherein you live</i>. We say, <i>unspotted</i>, and
so doth the Apostle, <i>Jam.</i> 1.27. It is not enough for
you to keep your selves from being <i>bemired and besmeared</i>,
but you must labour to keep your <i>Garments</i> so white,
as not to have the least <i>spot of defilement</i> from the persons
or places where you live. The Apostle tells us, That
<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_161" id="Ref_161" href="#Foot_161">[161]</a></span><i>in
the last daies perillous times shall come</i>: <i>For men should</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">{109}</a></span>
<i>be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud,
blasphemers, disobedient to Parents, unthankfull, unholy,
without naturall affection, truce-breakers, false Accusers, incontinent,
fierce, despisers of those that are good, Traytors,
heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more then lovers of
God; having a form of Godlinesse, but denying the power
thereof.</i> Those words, <i>having a form of Godlinesse</i>, must
be understood, <span title="apo koinou">απο κοινου</span>, and referred to all the other
sins. And the meaning is, That men would be <i>self-lovers</i>,
having a form of godlinesse, <i>truce-breakers</i>, having
a form of godliness, <i>truce-breakers</i>, having a form
of godlinesse, <i>Traytors and false accusers</i>, having a form
of godlinesse, <i>&amp;c</i>. They should cover all their ungodlinesse,
under the specious form of Godliness: Such are
the times in which we live, of which we may truly say,
There were never fewer, and yet never more Saints;
never more nominal, never fewer real Saints; Never
more self-seekers, and yet never more that pretended to
seek the interest of Christ. We are an <i>hypocritall Nation</i>,
<i>the people of Gods wrath</i>; <i>We have broken the Covenant of
our God, even that Covenant, which in the day of our distress
and fear, we made with hands lifted up to heaven. We are
apostatized from our Principles and practices; We contemn
the pretious ordinances, despise and abuse the Godly Ministers;
We break the Sabbaths, hate the very name of Reformation,
and scorn to submit to the sweet yoke of Christ and his
Government; We are proud, secure, lyars, swearers, and forswearers,
Murderers, drunkards, Adulterers, and oppressors: We have
not learned Righteousnesse, but unrighteousness, by all the Judgements
of God; We are worse and worse by all our deliverances;
We have spilt the blood of Christ in the Sacrament, by our unworthy
receiving</i>, and therefore it hath been just with God to spill
our blood. It would be too long to reckon up all the
particular sins of Magistrates, Ministers, Husbands,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">{110}</a></span>
wives, Fathers, Children, Masters, and Servants; neither
is it the design of this Discourse. We may truly say
with the Prophet, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_162" id="Ref_162" href="#Foot_162">[162]</a></span><i>Ah
sinful Nation, a people laden with iniquity;
a seed of evill doers, children that are corrupters, that have forsaken
the Lord, that have provoked the holy One of Israel unto anger;
that are gone away backward: Why should we be smitten
any longer? we will revolt more and more, the whole head is sick,
and the whole heart is faint; from the sole of the foot, even unto the
head, there if no soundness in us, but wounds and bruises, and
putrified sores</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Wherefore dearly beloved, we do most earnestly beseech you, in the
bowels of Jesus Christ, that you would be deeply sensible of, and
humbled for these evills that do so much abound in the midst of us,
for which the Earth mourns, and the Heavens are black over us. <i>Oh
let your souls weep in secret, and your eyes weep sore, and run down
with tears, and sigh to the breaking of your loyns, yea to the
breaking of your hearts with godly sorrow, which may work in you
repentance, never to be repented of.</i> Mourn more for the sins that
have brought these miseries upon us, then for the miseries our sins
have brought; more, for burdening God with sin, then for being
burdened with plagues; more for your hard hearts, then these hard
times.</p>

<p>And we further intreat everie one of you, to put
<i>away the iniquity that is in his hand</i>; <i>to know every man
the plague that is in his own heart</i>; <i>to search and try his
waies, and to turn unto the Lord his God</i>; <i>to cease to do evill,
and to learn to do well</i>: to be tender of the oathes which
he hath taken, or which may be offered unto him to
take; to keep close to his <i>Covenant</i>; to prize the
Ordinances, Reverence Godly Ministers, sanctifie the Sabbaths,
to hate hypocrisie and self seeking, to receive
the love of the truth, lest God give him over to believe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">{111}</a></span>
lyes. Not to trust to his own understanding, lest God
blind his understanding. To practise the <i>truths</i> he doth
know, that God may reveal unto him the <i>truths</i> he doth
not know; not to heap to himself teachers, having <i>itching
ears</i>, lest he <i>turn away his ears from the truth, and be
turned unto fables</i>; not to have the faith of our Lord Jesus
Christ, in respect of persons, imbracing the Doctrine
for the persons sake, and not the person for the Doctrines
sake. To seek after the truth, for the truths sake,
with uprightness of heart, and not for outward respects,
lest God answer thee according to the Idols thou hast
in thy heart. To labour to be more and more grounded
in the Principles of the Doctrine of Christ; to study
catechisme more diligently, and so to be led on to perfection,
that he may not alwayes be a babe, unskilfull
in the word of Righteousness, but by reason of use, may
have his senses exercised to discern both good and evil.</p>

<p class="thtbrk">In a word, we once more beseech you all that are admitted to our
Sacraments, that your <i>conversation may be as becometh the Gospell of
Christ</i>; and as you have given up your names unto Christ by
profession, so give up your hearts to him, by universall, sincere, and
constant obedience: <i>And let every one that nameth the name of Christ,
depart from iniquity.</i></p>

<p class="dropcap-fnt">OUr third and last Exhortation is unto all those <i>that live within
the bounds of the Province, and have not yet submitted to the
Government, nor are admitted to the Sacrament of the body and blood of
Christ in the</i> Presbyterian way: These may be reduced into two
ranks:</p>

<p>1. Such as separate from our Churches.</p>

<p>2. Such as continue still with us, but do not joyn in the Sacrament.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">{112}</a></span>
The first of these admit of so many <i>divisions</i>, and <i>subdivisions</i>,
and are so contrary not only to us, but one to another, as that we are
hardly able to rank them into order; and yet for method sake, we will
divide them into two sorts:</p>

<p>1. <i>Such as separate from us, only for matter of Government.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>Such as separate from us, for matter of doctrine also.</i></p>

<p>1. <i>Such as separate from us, only for matter of Government.</i> To these
we have spoken already in our Vindication; We now think fit to add one
thing more;</p>

<p>And that is, To beseech and intreat you, as Brethren, to consider,
what a sin it is, to separate from Churches, which you your selves
acknowledg to be true Churches of Jesus Christ; and that, while they
are endeavouring more and more after a reformation according to the
Word; and to set up Churches of another constitution; Is not this to
set up Church against Church? and as the Ancients were wont to express
it, <i>Altar against Altar</i>? And whereas you should rather joyn with us,
and put to your helping hand to reform the Nation, and to bring our
Churches into the order of the Gospel; do you not rather weaken our
hands, by dividing from us, and dividing of us; and thereby
obstructing and hindering the glorious work of Reformation? For what
with the Prelatical on the one hand, that will not come up to a
Scripture-Reformation; and with you on the other, that will not joyn
with us whilest we are endeavouring after a Scripture-Reformation, The
building of Gods house ceaseth, in most parts of the Kingdome; and
instead of a Reformation, we see nothing but deformation and
desolation. If we be the <i>Church of Christ, and Christ holdeth
communion with us, Why do you separate from us? If we be of the
body of Christ,</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">{113}</a></span>
<i>do not they that separate from the body, separate from the
head also?</i> We are loath to speak any thing, that may
offend you; yet we intreat you to consider, That if the
Apostle calls those divisions of the Church of <i>Corinth</i>,
wherein Christians did not separate into divers formed
Congregations of several communion in the Sacrament
of the Lords Supper, <i>Schismes</i>, 1&nbsp;<i>Cor.</i> 1.10. May
not your <i>secession</i> from us, and <i>profession</i> that you cannot
joyn with Us as members, and setting up Congregations
of another communion be more properly called
<i>schisme</i>? The Greek word for <i>Schism</i> signifies <i>rending</i>;
and sure it is, that you rend your selves from Us,
and not, <i>as from Churches the same rule</i>, but <i>as Churches
differing in the rule</i>, with a dislike of Us, and a protestation,
that You cannot joyn with Us as fixed members
without sin; You hear Us preach, not as persons in Office,
but as gifted men only; and some of you refuse to
hear us preach at all: You renounce all <i>Church communion</i>
with us as members; and not only so, but you invite
our people from Us, by telling them, <i>That they cannot
continue with us without sin</i>: You gather Churches
out of our Churches, and You set up Churches in an
opposite way to our Churches; and all this you do voluntarily,
(not separated, but separating, <i>non fugati, sed
fugitivi</i>) and unwarrantably, not having any sufficient
cause for it; and notwithstanding all this, yet you acknowledge
Us to be the true Churches of Jesus Christ,
and Churches with which Christ holds communion.
May we not therefore most justly charge you as guilty
in making a Schism in the Body of Christ?</p>

<p>We are far from thinking, that every difference in
Judgment, or every separation from a Church, maketh
a Schism; for it is not the Separation, but the Cause,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">{114}</a></span>
that makes the Schismatick. The Godly-learned say,
<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_163" id="Ref_163" href="#Foot_163">[163]</a></span><i>That
every unjust, and rash separation from a true Church</i>,
(that is, when there is no just cause, or at least no sufficient
cause of the separation) is a schism. And that there
is <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_164" id="Ref_164" href="#Foot_164">[164]</a></span>a
negative and positive schism, the former is, when
men do peaceably and quietly draw from communion
with a Church, not making a head against that Church
from which they are departed: the other is, when persons
so withdrawing, do consociate &amp; draw themselves
into a distinct and opposite Bodie, seting up a Church
against a Church (as you do;) which <i>Camero</i> cals <i>A schism
by way of eminencie</i>, &amp; further tels us, that there are <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_165" id="Ref_165" href="#Foot_165">[165]</a></span>four
causes that make a separation from a Church, lawful.</p>

<p>1. When they that separate, are grievously and intollerably
persecuted.</p>

<p>2. When the Church they separate from, is heretical.</p>

<p>3. When it is Idolatrical.</p>

<p>4. When it is the Seat of Antichrist. And where
none of these four are to be found, there the separation
is insufficient and schismatical. Now we are fully assured,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">{115}</a></span>
that none of these four causes can be justly charged
upon our Congregations. And therefore you must
not be displeased with us, but with your selves, if we
blame you as guilty of a positive Schism.</p>

<p>There are two things will be objected against what is here said.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Object.</i> 1.</div>

<p>That you are forced to separate from Us, because of those sinfull
mixtures that are tolerated amongst Us; That our Congregations are
miscellaneous companies of all gatherings, without any due separation
of the wheat from the chaff: that all sorts are admitted even to
Sacramental communion. And that therefore you ought to come out from
amongst Us, that you be not made partakers of our sins.</p>

<p>We answer,</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i> 1.</div>

<p>1. That this charge, if understood of those Congregations, that are
reformed according to the rules of the Presbyterial Government, is
most untrue and unrighteous. It is sufficiently known what we suffer
in our estates, and in our outward peace and quiet, because we will
not allow of sinful mixtures in our Churches. The Lord that observes
our particular carriages knows, that we study purity of members, as
well as purity of Ordinances, and verity of doctrine. And though we
dare not make separation from a true Church, by departing from it, as
you do; yet we do make a separation in a true Church, by purging and
reforming it, which you do not do. The rule of the Assembly for the
Church-members, is very full: <i>That they must be visible Saints,
such as being of age, do professe Faith in Christ, and obedience unto
Christ, according to the rules of Faith and life, taught by Christ and
his Apostles.</i> Doth not the Scripture require more then this? why
then will ye separate from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">{116}</a></span>
us for sinfull mixtures, when we are purging out sinfull
mixtures? when God is coming towards us, why will
you run away from us? When God is building us up,
why are you so active in pulling us down? Are we not
coming out of the Wildernesse, and will you now forsake
us? It is not many years since the ship of this
Church was sinking into Popery, and then some of you
separated from it into other parts of the world. And
when of late years, there was hope through the mercy
of God, of saving the ship, you returned back; and instead
of helping to save her, you presently began to separate
from her; and whilest we were pumping to preserve
the ship, your practices have occasioned &amp; made
many leaks in it. This is a sad thing, and if rightly
apprehended, must sit sadly upon the spirits of some.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i> 2.</div>

<p>Suppose there were some sinfull mixtures at our Sacraments, yet we
conceive, this is not a sufficient ground of a negative, much lesse of
a positive separation. <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_166" id="Ref_166" href="#Foot_166">[166]</a></span>The
learned Author forementioned tells us,
that <i>corruption in manners crept into a Church, is not sufficient
cause of separation from it</i>. This he proves from Matth. 23.2, 3.
and he also gives this reason for it; Because <i>in what Church
soever, there purity of Doctrine, there God hath his Church, though
overwhelmed with scandalls. And therefore whosoever separates from
such an Assembly, separates from that place where God hath his Church,
which is rash and unwarrantable.</i></p>

<p>The Church of <i>Corinth</i> had such a profane mixture at their
Sacrament, as we believe few (if any) of our Congregations can be
charged withal. And yet the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">{117}</a></span>
Apostle doth not perswade thy godly party to separate,
much less to gather a Church out of a Church.
There were many godly and learned Non-conformists
of this last age, that were perswaded in their consciences,
that they could not hold communion with the
Church of <i>England</i>, in receiving the Sacrament kneeling,
without sin, yet did they not separate from her.
Indeed, in that particular act they withdrew, but yet
so, as that they held communion with her in the rest,
being far from a negative, much more from a positive
separation. Nay some of them, even then when our
Churches were full of sinfull mixtures, with great zeal
and learning, defended them so far, as to <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_167" id="Ref_167" href="#Foot_167">[167]</a></span>write against
those that did separate from them. He that will never
communicate with any Church, till every thing that
offendeth be removed out of it, must tarry till the great
day of judgment, when (and not till then) <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_168" id="Ref_168" href="#Foot_168">[168]</a></span><i>Christ will
send forth his Angels, to gather out of his Kingdome every
thing that offendeth, and them that do iniquity.</i> <i>Musculus</i>
tells us of a <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_169" id="Ref_169" href="#Foot_169">[169]</a></span><i>Schwenkfeldian</i>
at <i>Augusta</i>, whom he asked,
when he had <i>received the Sacrament</i>; he answered, <i>not
these twelve years</i>: He asked him the reason; he answered,
<i>Because he could not finde a Church which was inwardly
and outwardly adorned fit for a spouse of Christ, and that
he would defer receiving the Sacrament, till he could finde
such a one</i>. This man never did receive: No more will
any of his opinion. We speak not of these things, to justifie
the negligence and wickedness of Church-Officers,
in suffering these prophane mixtures; we have already
proved it to be their duty, to keep all visibly-wicked
persons from the Sacrament, and have given divers arguments
to perswade them thereunto. We have likewise
shewed it to be the duty of private members, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span>
do what in them lyes, for the removing of scandalls
out of the Church. If a brother offend them, they are
not to separate from him, (for this is not the way
of Christ, to <i>gain</i>, but to <i>destroy</i> his soul,) but they are to
tell him of it privately, and in an orderly way to bring
it to the Church. And when they have done their duty,
they have freed their own souls, and may safely and
comfortably communicate in that Church, without sin.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Object.</i> 2.</div>

<p>Though we do separate from you, yet we cannot stand charged with
<i>Schisme</i>, because the nature of Schisme consisteth in an open
breach of Christian love; and is such a separation, which is joyned
with a condemnation of those Churches from which they separate, as
false Churches, which we are far from.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></div>

<p>We grant, that to make up the formality of a <i>Schismatick</i>, there
must be added uncharitableness; as to make up the formality of an
<i>Heretique</i>, there must be added <i>obstinacy</i>. But yet as he
that denyeth a fundamental Article of Faith, is guilty of heresie,
though he add not <i>obstinacy</i> thereunto to make him an heretique;
so he that doth <i>unwarrantably</i> separate from a true Church, is
truly guilty of <i>Schisme</i>, though he add not
<i>uncharitableness</i> thereunto, to denominate him a compleat
Schismatique.</p>

<p>A Reverend Brother of your own, calleth <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_170" id="Ref_170" href="#Foot_170">[170]</a></span><i>Brownisme</i>,
<i>a bitter root of rigid separation</i>. And we beseech you,
with the spirit of meekness, to consider what bitter
fruits have sprung from your more moderate separation:
what great and wofull breaches have been made
upon the blessed grace of charity: what harsh and rigid
censures some of you have passed upon our persons
and government; calling us <i>Lordly, and Prelaticall</i>;
and it, <i>Tyrannical and prejudicial to civill States</i>, on purpose,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">{119}</a></span>
to make us, and it odious, and thereby to render
your persons and way the more amiable to the people.
And that which is more then this, Are there not some
of you, that choose rather to joyn with Anabaptists,
and Episcopal men, then with us? And that will give
letters dimissory to your members, to depart from you
to the Churches of the Anabaptists? and at the same
time, deny them to such as desire them, for to joyn with
Churches of our communion? Is not this to separate
with an open breach of Christian Charity? We charge
not these things upon all of you, but only upon some,
whose names we forbear to mention. And for our
parts, we do here profess, That it is and shall be our
great care, to study <i>purity and charity</i>, as well as <i>verity
and unity</i>; and <i>purity of members</i> according to the Word,
as well as of <i>Ordinances</i>.</p>

<p>We abhor an over rigid urging of uniformity in circumstantiall things.
And are far from the cruelty of that Gyant, <i>who laid upon a bed all
he took; and those who were too long, he cut them even with his bed;
and such as were too short, he stretched out to the length of it</i>.
God hath not made all men of a length, nor height. Mens parts, gifts,
graces differ; and if there should be no forbearance in matters of
inferior alloy, all the world would be perpetually quarrelling. If you
would fully know our judgments herein, we will present them in these
two Propositions:</p>

<p>1. That it is the duty of all Christians, to study to enjoy the
Ordinances of Christ in unity, and uniformity, as far as it is
possible; for the Scripture calls <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_171" id="Ref_171" href="#Foot_171">[171]</a></span>to
unity and uniformity, as well as
to purity and verity: and surely, it is not impossible to obtain this
so much desired unity and uniformity, because that God hath promised,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">{120}</a></span>
that his children shall serve him with <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_172" id="Ref_172" href="#Foot_172">[172]</a></span><i>one heart,
and with one way, and with one shoulder</i>. And that in the
days of the Gospel, <i>There shall be one Lord, and his name
one.</i> And Christ hath prayed, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_173" id="Ref_173" href="#Foot_173">[173]</a></span><i>That
we may be all one, as
the Father is in him, and he in the Father.</i> And he adds a
most prevalent reasons, <i>that the world may believe that
thou hast sent me</i>. Nothing hinders the propagation
of the Gospel, so much as the divisions and separations
of Gospel-Professors. If then it be Gods promise,
and Christs prayer, it is certainly a thing possible to be
obtained, and a duty incumbent upon all true Christians,
to labour after.</p>

<p>2. That is their duty to hold communion together, as one Church, in
what they agree; and in this way of union mutually to tolerate and
bear with one another in lesser differences. And here that golden Rule
of the Apostle takes place, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_174" id="Ref_174" href="#Foot_174">[174]</a></span><i>Let
us therefore as many as be perfect,
be thus minded; and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall
reveal even this unto you: Neverthelesse whereto we have already
attained, Let us walk by the same Rule, let us mind the same
thing.</i> This was the practice of the primitive Christians.</p>

<p>All such who professed Christianity, held Communion together, as one
Church, notwithstanding the difference of Judgements in lesser things,
and much corruption in conversation.</p>

<p>We beseech you therefore Brethren, that you would endeavour to keep
the <i>Unity of the spirit in the bond of peace; for there is one Body
and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your Calling; one
Lord, one Faith, and one Baptisme; one God and Father of all, who is
above all, and through all, and in you all.</i></p>

<p>For our parts, we do here manifest our willingness, (as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">{121}</a></span>
we have already said) to accommodate with you according
to the Word, in a way of union; And (such of us
as are Ministers,) to preach up, and to practise a mutual
forbearance and toleration in all things, <i>that may consist
with the fundamentalls of Religion, with the power of Godlinesse,
and with that peace which Christ hath established in
his Church</i>, but to make ruptures in the body of Christ,
and to divide Church from Church, and to set up
Church against Church, and to gather Churches out
of true Churches: And because we differ in some things,
therefore to hold Church-communion in Nothing; this
we think hath no warrant out of the Word of God, and
will introduce all manner of confusion in Churches and
Families; and not only disturb, but in a little time destroy
the power of Godlinesse, purity of Religion, peace
of Christians, and set open a wide gap to bring in
Atheisme, Popery, Heresie, and all manner of wickednesse:
We will therefore conclude with that description
that Doctor <i>Ames</i> gives of the sinfulnesse and mischievousnesse
of Schisme, lib. 5. cap. 12.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_175" id="Ref_175" href="#Foot_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>Schisme, properly so called, is a most grievous sin;</p>

<p>1. Because it is <i>against charity towards our Neighbour</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>2. Because it is <i>against the Edification of him who makes the
separation, in that he deprives himself Communion in spirituall
good</i>.</p>

<p>3. <i>Because it is against the honour of Christ, in that, at much
as in it lyeth, it takes away the Unity of his mysticall body.</i></p>

<p>4. <i>It makes way unto Heresie, and separation from Christ.</i> And
therefore it is a sin by all good men to be abhorred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">{122}</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Second sort of Separatists.</div>

<p>2. The second sort are such, as <i>separate from our Churches, as
false Churches</i>; And from our <i>Ministry, as Antichristian</i>: and
differ from us not only in Discipline, but in Doctrine also. We
purpose not to undertake a particular confutation of your Errours.</p>

<p>Four things only we have to say:</p>

<p>1. To beseech you to consider, whether you did not receive the <i>work
of Conversion from sin unto God, which ye presume to be wrought in you
first of all, in these publique assemblies, from which you now
separate?</i> And if once you found Christ walking amongst us, How is
it that you do now leave us? Do you not therein leave Christ also? Are
we lesse, and not rather more reformed then we were? If the presence
of Christ, both of his power and grace, be with us, why will you deny
us your presence? Are ye holier and wiser then Christ? Is not this an
evident token that we are true Churches, and have a true Ministry,
because we have the seal of our Ministry, even the conversion of many
sons and daughters unto God? Doth not the Apostle from this very
ground, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_176" id="Ref_176" href="#Foot_176">[176]</a></span>argue
the truth of his Apostleship? Is it not apparent, that
our Ministers are sent by God, Because their Embassage is made
successfull by God, for the good of souls? Did you ever read of true
conversion ordinarily in a false Church? Will the Lord concur with
those Ministers whom he sends not? Doth not the Prophet seem to say
the quite contrary, <i>Ier.</i> 23.33. And therefore either renounce
your conversion, or be converted from that great sin of separating
from us.</p>

<p>2. To consider, whether there was not a time, <i>when ye could have
plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to those Ministers,
whose eyes you would now pluck out, and whom now you hate, and think
you do God good service,</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">{123}</a></span>
<i>in reviling and persecuting them.</i> How is it, that you are
thus altered and changed? <i>Are they become your enemies,
because they tell you the truth?</i> You will Reply, It is because
they are <i>Ministers Ordained by Antichristian Bishops</i>;
and therefore before they have renounced their false
Ministry, we cannot with a safe conscience hear them,
nor expect a blessing from their Ministry. This Reply
is, we confess, a great stumbling block to many godly
people, in this Kingdome; for satisfaction to it, we offer
these particulars:</p>

<p>1. Many of you that make this Reply, hold, <i>That the Election of the
people is by Gods Word sufficient to make a man a true Minister
without Ordination.</i></p>

<p>Now it is certain, that many publique Ministers have been chosen by
the free and full consent of their Congregations; and most of them
have had an after consent, which was sufficient to make <i>Leah</i>
<i>Jacobs</i> wife<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_177" id="Ref_177" href="#Foot_177">[177]</a></span>,
and why not (to use your own words) to marry a man to
a people; and therefore according to your own judgments, all such are
lawfull Ministers. For sinfull superadditions do not nullifie divine
Institutions.</p>

<p>2. Some of you, that besides Election, require Ordination for the
making of a Minister, yet say, that this Ordination must be by the
people of the Congregation; and thus are your Ministers ordained.</p>

<p>Now we finde neither precept nor president for this
in all the Scripture; we finde <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_178" id="Ref_178" href="#Foot_178">[178]</a></span><i>Ordination
by the laying on
of the hands of the Presbytery</i>, but never of the laying on
of the hands of the people. We finde <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_179" id="Ref_179" href="#Foot_179">[179]</a></span>the
Apostles, <i>Timothy</i>
and <i>Titus</i>, <i>Ordaining</i>, but never the people <i>Ordaining</i>;
and for private persons to assume the power of
Ordination (that is, a power to send men to preach the
Gospel, and administer the Sacraments) is a sin like unto
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">{124}</a></span>
the sin of <i>Uzzah</i>, and of <i>Corah</i>, and his company.
Therefore we say to you, as Christ doth, <i>Matth.</i> 6.
<i>First pluck the beam out of thine own eye, and then</i>, &amp;c.
First justifie the Ordination of your own Ministers by
private persons, and then you will see better, to find fault
with the Ordination of our Ministers.</p>

<p>3. We distinguish between a defective Ministry, and a false Ministry,
as we do between a man that is lame or blind, and a man that is but
the picture of a man. We do not deny, but that the way of Ministers
entring into the Ministry by the Bishops, had many defects in it, for
which they ought to be humbled: But we add, that notwithstanding all
the accidental corruptions, yet it is not substantially and
essentially corrupted: As it is with Baptism in the Popish Church; all
Orthodox Divines account it valid, though mingled with much dross,
because the party baptized, is <i>baptized in the name of the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost</i>. And therefore, when a Papist turns
Protestant, he is not baptized again, because the substance of
Baptisme is preserved in Popery under many defects. The like, and much
more, may be said for the <i>Ordination of our Ministers by
Bishops</i>: It is lawful and valid for the substance of it, though
mingled with many circumstantial defects.</p>

<p>And this appears,</p>

<p>1. Because when they were ordained, <i>they were designed to no other
Office, but to preach the Word, and administer the Sacraments;
according to the Will of Christ.</i></p>

<p>2. Because since their Ordination, <i>God hath sealed the
truth of their Ministry</i> (as hath been said) <i>by his blessing
upon it</i>. If they be <i>Antichristian Ministers</i>, how is your
<i>conversion Christian</i>?</p>

<p>3. Because they were ordained by Bishops, not as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">{125}</a></span>
Lord Bishops, or as <i>a superiour Order by divine Right above
a Presbyter</i>; but as they were <i>Presbyters</i>. For the
understanding of which, you must know,</p>

<p>1. That by Scripture, a Bishop and Presbyter is all
one, as appears by <i>Act.</i> 10.27, 28. <i>Tit.</i> 1.5, 6, 7, 8. <i>Phil.</i>
1.1. 1&nbsp;<i>Tim.</i> 3.1, 2, &amp;c. 1&nbsp;<i>Pet.</i> 5.1, 2. and by what is said
by the Authors quoted in the <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_180" id="Ref_180" href="#Foot_180">[180]</a></span>Margent.</p>

<p>2. <i>That the Lordly Dignities of Bishops were meer civill
additaments annexed to their Bishopricks by Kingly favour.</i></p>

<p>3. That this Opinion, that <i>Bishops are a <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_181" id="Ref_181" href="#Foot_181">[181]</a></span>superiour
Order of Ministry, by Divine Right above a Presbyter, is a late upstart
Opinion, contrary to antiquity</i>, as appears by the Authors quoted
in the Margent.</p>

<p>4. That the Laws of this Realm do account nothing <i>divine</i> in a
Bishop, but his being a Presbyter; and therefore the Parliament in
their <i>Ordinance for Ordination</i>, tels us, <i>That they did ordain as
Presbyters, not as Bishops, much lesse as Lord Bishops</i>.</p>

<p>As for their usurpation of the sole power of Jurisdiction, together
with their Lordly Titles &amp; Dignities, and Dependances, we have
renounced them in our <i>Solemn League and Covenant</i>: But we never did,
nor never shall renounce them as <i>Presbyters</i>, which by the consent
of all sides, are by <i>Divine Right</i>.</p>

<p>We shall add one thing more,</p>

<p>4. That Ministers do not receive their Ministry from the People, or
Bishops, but immediatly from Jesus Christ: For they are Ministers and
Embassadors of Christ, not of the People: Indeed they are Embassadors
for the good of the People, but not Embassadors of the People: All
that the people or Bishop doth, is but to <i>choose</i> and <i>ordain</i> a man;
but it is Christ that gives him his <i>power and authority</i>; As when a
wife <i>chooseth a</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">{126}</a></span>
<i>husband</i>, and a Town a Mayor; the Town doth not give
the Mayor, nor the wife the husband, the power they
have; but the <i>Laws of God</i>, the one and of <i>Man</i>, the other:
So it is here, It is Christ that gives the Office, and the
Call to the Ministry; They are his <i>Servants</i>, and in his
<i>Name</i> execute their function. It is he that fits them with
ability for their work; the people they consent, and the
<i>Bishop as a Presbyter, with other Presbyters, ordain him</i>;
which though it had many Corruptions mingled with
it, when the <i>Bishop</i> was in all his pomp and Lordliness,
yet for the substance of it, it was lawful &amp; warrantable,
and <i>therefore cannot without sin be renounced and abjured</i>.</p>

<p>3. In the third place we exhort you to consider, <i>whether since you
have forsaken our Congregations, you have not fallen into such strange
opinions, and those of so high a nature, as that if any man should
have told you seven years ago, that you would have one time or another
fall into them, you would have said to him, as</i> Hazael <i>did to the
Prophet; Am I a dog, that I should do this?</i> Who would ever
have thought, that you that did once sigh, mourn, and bitterly
complain, <i>That a Chappell was permitted to the Queen to hear Masse
in, should now plead for a toleration of Popery, and all manner of
Errours and Heresies? That you that did once flock to our Churches as
Doves to the windows, should now not only forsake ours, but all
Churches of whatever constitution; That you that did once so much
prize Christ, and his holy Scriptures, should now (some of you at
least) deny the Divinity of Christ, and his holy Scriptures?</i> But
this is no great wonder, for the Apostle hath foretold it, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_182" id="Ref_182" href="#Foot_182">[182]</a></span><i>That
evill men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being
deceived</i>; and that <i>they will increase unto more ungodliness, and
their word will eat as doth a Canker</i>, &amp;c. <i>Errour</i> is of an
incroaching nature; as the <i>little Theef</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">{127}</a></span>
openeth the <i>door</i> oftentimes to the <i>great Theef</i> so a little
<i>errour</i> paves a cause-way to a greater: The <i>Popish superstition</i>
at first grew secretly, the <i>tares</i> were hidden under
the <i>corn</i>; but in a little while the <i>tares</i> grew up, so as
no <i>corn</i> could be seen: Images, at first were brought into
the Church <i>only for an historicall use</i>; afterwards, to stir
up <i>devotion</i>, at last, they came to be <i>worshipped</i>: Let the
Serpent but winde in his head, &amp; he will quickly bring
in his whole body: Your <i>first errour</i> was in <i>separating
from our Churches</i>, from which <i>Christ doth not separate</i>.
Here the <i>Serpent got in his head</i>, &amp; no wonder his whole
body <i>followed</i>; he that saith <i>yea</i> to the Devil in a little,
shall not say <i>nay</i> when he please: He that tumbleth down
the <i>Hill of Error</i>, will never leave tumbling, till he comes
to the <i>bottome</i>. First you deny our Ministers to be true
Ministers, and our Ordinances to be true Ordinances;
and then God, as a just Judge, gives you over, in a little
time, to deny all <i>Ministers and Ordinances</i>, and then
to be <i>above all Ministers and Ordinances</i>; and at last, to be
above Christ himself, and not to stand in need of his
<i>mediation to God the Father</i>. First you deny <i>Baptisme of
Infants</i>, and then after, <i>Baptisme of water</i>: In a word, First
you <i>run away from us</i>, and then for the most part turn <i>Independents</i>,
then <i>Antinomians</i>, then <i>Anabaptists</i> then <i>Arminians</i>,
then some of you <i>Socinians</i>, <i>Antiscripturists</i>, <i>Anti-Trinitarians</i>,
still waxing worse and worse, deceiving
and being deceived, &amp; in the conclusion, meer <i>Atheists</i>.</p>

<p>Suffer us therefore to speak to you in the words of Christ, to the
Church of <i>Ephesus</i>. Rev. 2.5. <i>Remember from whence you are faln,
and repent, and do your first works</i>, &amp;c. Repent of all your
Soul-destroying <i>Errours</i>, and return to the Churches from which
ye have most unjustly separated, for fear, lest <i>God as a just Judge</i>,
because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">{128}</a></span>
you would not receive the love of the truth that you
might be saved, should still give you over to strong delusions,
that ye should believe a lye, <i>That all they might
be damned, who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in
unrighteousnesse</i>: And this makes way to the fourth
thing we have to say to you; and that is,</p>

<p>4. To beseech you to consider, <i>Whether since you forsook
our Congregations, you are not much decayed in the power
of Godliness</i>, whether you have not lost your first love
to Godly Ministers, Gospel-Ordinances, Fastings, reading
the Word, private &amp; Family prayers, and Communion
of Saints; whether you are not grown more censorious,
self-conceited, headie, high-minded, treacherous,
fierce, despisers of those that are good, and lovers of
pleasure more then lovers of God; whether Duties to
God and Man have not been more neglected, Sabbaths
more prophaned, Families worse governed; the publique
welfare of Church and State have not been less
minded, whether prophaneness, or prophane Ones, have
not been more indulged; and whether you be not sensibly
and dangerously apostatized from that close and
humble walking with God, which formerly some of
you did so much labour after: For the truth is, <i>Corruption
in the Judgment, will quickly bring corruption in the
conversation</i>. Our actions are guided by our apprehensions;
and if our apprehensions be <i>erroneous</i>, our <i>actions</i>
will quickly be tainted with wickednesse; And therefore
it is very observeable, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_183" id="Ref_183" href="#Foot_183">[183]</a></span><i>That
in the old Law, when the
Leprosie was in the head, the Priest was not only to pronounce
the man unclean, but utterly unclean</i>: For Leprosie in the
head, will quickly beget a Leprosie in the whole man:
As the Sun is to the World; so is the Understanding to
Man: If the Sun be dark, all the world is in darknesse;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">{129}</a></span>
and if the light that is in thee (saith Christ) be darkness,
<i>How great is that darkness?</i> We wonder not at the <i>looseness</i>
of your practices, when we consider the <i>looseness</i> of
your principles: <i>For Doctrines contrary to Godliness, must
needs bring forth a conversation contrary to the Gospell.</i> And
this is an evident token to us, that the <i>New-Lights</i> (as
they are called) which you hold forth to the world,
proceed not from the <i>Father of Lights</i>, but the <i>Prince of
Darkness</i>, because they lead men into the <i>Works of Darkness</i>.</p>

<p>Therefore seeing that since your departure from us, you have wofully
back-slidden from God, and are visibly decaid in Holiness and
Righteousness, Our Exhortation to you is, that you would return to
your first Principles; for then it was better with you, then now; And
our prayer to God for you is, <i>That he would give you repentance to
the acknowledging of the truth; and that you may recover your selves
out of the snare of the Devill, who are taken captive by his will.</i></p>

<p>Having finished that we had to say to those that separate from our
Church, we now go on to speak a few words to those that <i>continue
with us still, and that wait upon the publique Ministry, but do not
yet joyn with us, in partaking of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper</i>.
These we shall divide into three ranks.</p>

<p>1. Such as are <i>young people</i>, not yet sufficiently instructed in
the grounds of Religion.</p>

<p>2. Such as are <i>grown in years</i>, and come to our Churches, but yet
are scandalous in life and conversation.</p>

<p>3. Such as live, for ought we know, unblameably, but yet refuse to
come to the Sacrament in the Presbyterian way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">{130}</a></span>
1. Such as are <i>young people</i>, and not yet sufficiently instructed
in the grounds of Religion; Our Exhortation
to you is, <i>That you would remember your Creator in
the days of your Youth</i>; the word in the Hebrew<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_184" id="Ref_184" href="#Foot_184">[184]</a></span> is, in the
choyce of thy dayes: The time of Youth is the Golden
Age; and grace in Youth, is like a Jewel in a gold-ring.
The time of Youth, it is the <i>Seasoning Age</i>: A Vessell
will of a long time retain the savour of that liquor that
it is first seasoned withall; <i>Teach a child</i> (saith Solomon)
<i>the trade of his way, and he will not depart from it when he
is old</i>. The time of Youth is the chiefe time you have
to <i>work for heaven</i>. Old age is a time to <i>spend grace</i>; but
Youth is the time to get it: Old Age is the time to <i>reap</i>
the fruit of holiness, but Youth is the time to <i>sow</i> the
seed of it: And it is a time, that of all times God doth
most require, and most delight in. It is observed by
one, that Christ <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_185" id="Ref_185" href="#Foot_185">[185]</a></span><i>loved
his youngest Disciple best</i>: And by
Another, that Christ was <i>wonderfully delighted</i> with
that <i>Hosanna</i> that the children sang unto him, Mat. 21.16. <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_186" id="Ref_186" href="#Foot_186">[186]</a></span><i>The
childrens Hosanna pleased him no less then the
mens Hallelujahs; Suffer little children to come unto me</i>,
saith Christ, <i>for to them belongeth the Kingdome of God.</i>
In the Old Testament God hath manifested a great deal
of love to young people; He chose <i>Abel</i>, the younger,
<i>Shem</i>, the younger, <i>Abraham</i>, the younger, <i>Jacob</i>, the
younger; young <i>Samuel</i>, and young <i>David</i>, and young
<i>Josiah</i>: And therefore let young men, especially, be exhorted
to begin betimes, to bear the yoak of the Lord;
<i>Seek ye first the Kingdome of God, and his Righteousness</i>;
first, <i>before</i> any thing else; and first, <i>more</i> then any other
thing. Say not, (O say not!) I am a young man, and
therefore may plead for liberty to do what I list, till
I come of riper years: But remember, <i>That Jesus</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">{131}</a></span>
<i>Christ shed his blood for thee when he was 8. dayes old</i>; and
took thee into his Family by <i>Baptisme</i>, <i>when thou didst
hang upon thy mothers Breast</i>; Thou art (it may be) a
young man, but a Baptized young-man; A Young-man
consecrated and dedicated to God; And it is not
only sin, but sacriledg and perjury, to <i>impropriate that
that is dedicated to God, to the service of the Devill</i>. Remember
the wrath manifested from Heaven <i>against the
42. children</i> that mocked <i>Elisha</i>; And remember further,
That young people must dye, as well as old:
<i>There are Skulls in Golgotha, of all sizes</i>; and young people
have <i>immortall souls</i>, and must appear at the great
day of Judgment, as well as <i>old</i>; Young people are by
nature <i>children of wrath, heires of hell</i>; and therefore this
is thy first work (<i>O young man</i>) to get out of the Root
of Abomination, into the Root of Acceptation; out of
the old <i>Adam</i> into the new <i>Adam</i>; &amp; before this be done,
(though thou shouldst spend thy time in gathering up
Pearls and Jewels,) thou art an undone creature.</p>

<p>For the better effecting of this, we exhort you, to attend
diligently to the publike Preaching of the Word, and willingly
and cheerfully to submit to be catechized and instructed
by your <i>Parents, Masters, and Ministers</i>. The Scripture divideth
a Congregation, into him that <i>catechizeth</i>, and those that
are <i>catechized</i>, saying, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_187" id="Ref_187" href="#Foot_187">[187]</a></span><i>Let
them that are taught</i>, or (as it is in the
Greek) <i>Catechized, communicate to him that teacheth</i> (or <i>catechizeth</i>)
<i>them in all good things</i>. In the Primitive times, when
any Heathen man was converted to Christianity, he was first a
<i>catechumenus</i>, before he was admitted either to <i>Baptisme</i>, or
the <i>Lords Supper</i>. And <i>Egesippus</i> testifies, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_188" id="Ref_188" href="#Foot_188">[188]</a></span><i>that
by the diligent instruction of the Church, there was no known Common-Wealth in
any part of the World, inhabited, but within fourty years after
Christs passion, received a great shaking of Heathenish Religion.</i>
There are in Christian Religion, <i>fundamentalls</i> and <i>superstructions</i>.
The <i>fundamentalls</i> are the vitals of Christianity:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">{132}</a></span>
These are comprized in many of our <i>English</i> Catechismes.
Amongst all others, we do more especially
commend the <i>greater and lesser Catechismes made by the
Reverend Assembly of Divines</i>, <i>and published to be used in
all Churches in</i> England <i>and</i> Wales, <i>by Authority of Parliament</i>.
These we exhort you, not only to read, but to
learn. And to invite you thereunto, we further declare;</p>

<p>That the study of the Catechisme, is a singular help for the <i>right
understanding</i> of the Scriptures: (For the Catechisme is nothing
else, but a Methodical Extract out of the Bible, of the fundamentals
of Christian Religion;) And it is also very useful to make you
understand what your <i>Ministers preach to you</i>; And to keep you
from the <i>Errours</i> and <i>Heresies of these times</i> to prepare
you to give a distinct and perfect account of your Faith to the
Minister and Elders. For one great Reason why men do so pervert the
Scriptures to their own destruction, and run wilde into so many errors
and heresies, and are so unable to give a particular and distinct
account to the Minister and Elders, is for want of the study of the
Catechisme. As a ship <i>without ballast</i> is tossed about with
every wave and wind; so is a <i>man without the study of the
Catechisme</i>, carried about with every wind of vain doctrine. As a
<i>house</i> without a foundation will quickly fall, so will a
Christian that is not well verst in the fundamentals of Religion. As
Children grow <i>crooked</i>, that are not well looked to at first; so
many run into <i>crooked opinions</i>, because not well catechized.</p>

<p>And therefore we earnestly beseech and intreat all Parents, and
Masters of Families, that they would make conscience of this great
duty of catechizing their children and servants. And oh that the Lord
would make our words to take impression upon your hearts. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">{133}</a></span>
Old Testament God commands Parents to <i>teach diligently
their children</i>. The word in the Hebrew<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_189" id="Ref_189" href="#Foot_189">[189]</a></span>
is, to <i>whet the Law</i> upon their children. The fourth Commandement
is directed not to children, and servants, but to
Parents and Masters; And they are there commanded,
not only <i>in their own persons</i>, to keep the Sabbath; but
to see that their <i>children and servants do it also</i>. It is not,
<i>Thou, or thy son, or thy daughter; But thou, nor thy son, nor thy
daughter</i>. It doth not say, (as <i>Zanchy</i> well observes<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_190" id="Ref_190" href="#Foot_190">[190]</a></span>,)
<i>Remember thou to keep holy the Sabbath day, and to perswade thy children and
servants to keep it holy</i>: But <i>remember thou to keep it holy, and
thy son, and thy servant</i>, implying thereby, <i>that it is the Duty of
the Master and Father, to compell his servant and children to the
keeping of the Sabbath day</i>. For doing of this, God exceedingly
extols <i>Abraham</i>, Gen. 18.19. <i>I know that he will command his
children, and his household after him, that they keep the wayes of the
Lord</i>: upon which words, a learned Divine wrote thus; <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_191" id="Ref_191" href="#Foot_191">[191]</a></span><i>Abraham
did not leave his children and servants to their own genius,
their own counsels, their own lusts, though it is certain, divers of
them would have thanked him for such a liberty; for they had been
nursed up in superstition and idolatry, as</i> Abraham <i>was, and might
have pretended, that they were not satisfied in point of conscience.
But</i> Abraham <i>knew how to distinguish between liberty of conscience,
and liberty of lust, and therefore would not allow them such a
liberty as would have enticed them into the worst kinde of bondage.</i>
The New Testament also calls upon Parents, not only to bring
up their children, but to <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_192" id="Ref_192" href="#Foot_192">[192]</a></span><i>nurture
them up in instruction and admonition
of the Lord</i>. Old <i>Eli</i> was <i>grievously punished</i> for neglect of
this duty: And let his severe chastisement be as a <i>warning-piece</i>
to all Fathers and Masters; And let them
know, <i>That if their children and servants perish for want of
instruction, through their negligence, their blood will be required
at their hands.</i></p>

<p>And if Parents and Masters, much more ought Ministers to be very
conscientious in the diligent discharge of this duty. Our Saviour
Christ layeth an express command
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">{134}</a></span>
upon them, not only <i>to feed the sheep</i>, <i>but also the
lambs of Christ</i>. It is no disparagement to a <i>Peter</i>, to be a
<i>feeder of Christs lambs</i>. Oh that Ministers would unanimously
and universally set to this duty! We commend
it to them, as a most <i>Soveraign Antidote</i>, to preserve their
Congregations from the errours of these times. It is
reported of <i>Julian</i>, that amongst other subtile plots he
used for the rooting out of Christian Religion; One
was the <i>suppression of all Christian Schools</i>, and places of
catechizing. <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_193" id="Ref_193" href="#Foot_193">[193]</a></span>And
as one saith, <i>If he had not been as a
Cloud that soon passeth away, it had been to be feared, lest
within a short time he had overshadowed all Religion.</i> For
when Catechizing was taken from the Church, it was
presently all overspread with ignorance. And it is
further added by the same Author, That the Papists
themselves acknowledg, that all the advantage the Protestants
got of them in the beginning of Reformation,
was by their catechizing; because they began sooner to
catechize, then they did. And it is to be feared, saith he,
if ever the Papists get once again advantage of Us, it
will be by their exacter catechizing, then ours. And
therefore, if ever you would prevent the further <i>corruption</i>
of mens Judgments, and secure them from the infection
of <i>errour</i>, and preserve Religion from ruine. We
exhort you in the bowels of our Lord Jesus Christ, to
practise this duty; and intreat our people with all readiness
and constancie, to submit unto this Ordinance of
God, which with so much publique prejudice, hath
been so long neglected.</p>

<p>And to perswade people thereunto, let them consider
further,</p>

<p>1. If Ministers are bound to catechize; then people
are bound to be catechized.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">{135}</a></span>
2. That they are baptized, and thereby consecrated unto Christ, and
obliged by promise, to give up themselves unto instruction.</p>

<p>3. That ignorance, though it be not the greatest, yet it is a most
dangerous sin: All sin is wrapt up in ignorance, as a child in
swadling clouts. The Scripture saith, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_194" id="Ref_194" href="#Foot_194">[194]</a></span><i>That
Christ will come in flaming fire to render vengeance upon all those that know him not</i>,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>It makes the <i>ignorance of God</i> to be the cause of all sin, 1&nbsp;<i>Sam.</i>
2.12. 1&nbsp;<i>Joh.</i> 2.4. <i>Eph.</i> 4.19. And <i>David</i> prayeth unto God, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_195" id="Ref_195" href="#Foot_195">[195]</a></span><i>To
pour out his wrath upon the heathen that know him not</i>; how much
more upon the Christians that know him not? As toads and Serpents
grow in dark and dirty sellars: so all sin and wickednesse
in an ignorant and blind soul. Now there is no ordinary way
for young people to gain the knowledge of God, but by <i>Catechizing</i>.</p>

<p>4. That the time of youth is the <i>golden Age</i>, the <i>seasoning age</i>,
and a time in which men are apt to receive abiding impressions of evil,
or good. And if they can learn to say to <i>Elisha</i>, <i>Bald-pate</i>, why
should they be unwilling to learn to sing to Christ, <i>Hosanna</i>?</p>

<p>5. That it is not so great a shame for young people to be ignorant, as
to be wilful and obstinate in ignorance. And if they refuse to be
<i>Catechised</i>, they shall perish in their ignorance; but the
<i>Minister</i> is free from the blood of their souls.</p>

<p>The second sort are such <i>as live within the bounds of our Province,
and come to our Congregations, and yet are wicked and prophane, and
such, as if they should come to be examined by the Minister and
Elders, would not be received to the Sacrament</i>. These are Christians
in <i>name</i>, but they are a shame to the <i>name</i>, and bear it (as <i>Urijah</i>
did a letter to <i>Joab</i>) <i>for their ruine and destruction</i>. We beseech
and intreat them to consider, what a sinful and cursed condition it is
to live ungodlily and unrighteously under the abundance of
Gospel-Ordinances.</p>

<p>First, what a <i>sinful condition</i> it is; For,</p>

<p>1. It is as much as in them lyes, a frustrating of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">{136}</a></span>
great love of Christ in dying for them: For, therefore
Christ dyed, <i>that they which live, should not henceforth
live unto themselves, but unto him which dyed for them, and
rose again</i>, 2&nbsp;Cor. 5.13.</p>

<p>2. It is a frustrating of the gracious design of God, in sending the
Gospel to them; for one chief errand of the Gospel, is to <i>teach us
to deny ungodlinesse and worldly lusts, and to live soberly,
righteously, and godly in this present world</i>, Tit. 2.12.</p>

<p>3. It is not only to sin against the <i>light of nature</i>, but against
the <i>light of the Gospel</i>.</p>

<p>4. Not only against the <i>creating and preserving mercies of God</i>, but
against the <i>heart-blood mercy</i> of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>5. It is a sin of <i>horrible ingratitude and unthankfulness</i>; a sin
that makes God himself to stand, as it were, amazed, that any man
should be so wicked, as to be guilty of it, <i>Isai.</i> 1.2. <i>Jer.</i>
2.11, 12.</p>

<p>6. It is a sin that will make us speechlesse, and unexcusable at the
great day, <i>Joh.</i> 15.22.</p>

<p>7. It is a sin that renders a Christian worse then the very bruit
creatures, <i>Isa.</i> 1.3. And in this one sense, worse then the Devills
themselves, because the Devills never refused so great salvation.</p>

<p>2. Consider what a cursed condition this is: For,</p>

<p>1. It is a <i>spirituall plague</i>, which is so much greater then a
corporal, by how much the Soul is better then the Body.</p>

<p>2. It is a sign not only of Gods Fatherly, but revengeful displeasure,
<i>a brand of reprobation, and the high-way to damnation</i>.</p>

<p>3. It renders a man utterly uncapable (as such) of the Sacrament of
the body and bloud of Christ; for Christ
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">{137}</a></span>
ordained the Sacrament for his friends, not for his enemies;
to increase, not beget grace; for those that are
visible Saints, not for those that are visibly wicked.</p>

<p>4. It brings <i>Personall, Congregationall</i>, and <i>Nationall
Judgments</i>, Luk. 13.5. Isa. 5.</p>

<p>5. It makes a Christians condition at the day of Judgment more
intolerable, then the condition of <i>Sodom and Gomorrah</i>. It makes the
Gospel it self to be the chiefest inditement against him; and the
hottest place in Hell to be his portion for ever, and ever.</p>

<p>Oh that the Lord would give hearts to these men to meditate on these
things! and to repent of all their swearing, cursing, lying,
drunkenness, fornication, adultery, Sabbath-breaking, and such like
abominations! And let them not be offended with us, (as most of them
are) for not admitting them to the Sacrament; but rather offended with
their sins, that make them uncapable, as such, of the Sacrament. Let
not them cry out against us, but against themselves; and study to be
revenged, not of their Ministers and Elders, but of their sins, and
themselves. The Lord knows, that it is meer love to the Lord Jesus
Christ, and tender pity and compassion to their and our own souls,
that forceth us to deny them this Ordinance; lest we should be
instrumental to their eating and drinking their own damnation, and
accessary to their unworthy receiving, and to the prophanation of the
Sacrament; <i>Let not our pity, love, and care to them, breed hatred
against us, in them.</i> And why should they desire to partake in
these holy mysteries, whose hearts and lives are so full of
unholinesse? why should they that want spirituall life, desire to eat
of spirituall food? What should men spiritually dead, do at a
spiritual feast? why should they desire to eat that bread,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">{138}</a></span>
which will certainly, as long as they continue in this
condition, be the bread of death, not of life; and to
drink that cup, which will certainly be a cup, not of salvation,
but of damnation! Let our counsel be acceptable
to you; <i>First wash you, make ye clean, put away the
evill of your doings from before Gods eyes, cease to do
evill, learn to do well</i>; and then come and see whether
we will not receive you heartily and joyfully to the Sacrament.
<i>First wash your hands in innocency, and then you
will be fit to compasse the Lords Altar.</i> First get <i>spirituall
life, and then come and eat spirituall food</i>. First get to be
a friend and Disciple of Christ; and then not only We,
but Christ himself, will bid you welcome, and make
you partakers of all the benefits and comforts of the
blessed Sacrament.</p>

<p>The third and last sort, <i>are such as come to our Congregation, and
live</i> (for ought we know) <i>unblameably</i>; and yet refuse to joyn
with Us in the Sacrament upon this account, because they will not come
to be examined by the Minister and Elders. This (as we find by woful
experience) is the great mountain that lyeth in the way, and hindereth
the free passage of the Presbyterial-Government; and therefore we have
taken some pains in our Vindication for the removing of it; we have
shewed,</p>

<p>1. That the Ruling-Elder (which is the Officer so much opposed) hath a
Divine Warrant.</p>

<p>2. It is the Will of Jesus Christ, that they that come to the
Sacrament, should first submit themselves to Examination; and not only
so, but to <i>Examination by Minister and Elders</i>.</p>

<p>3. What this Examination is, which is required, and how often it is
required.</p>

<p>4. The reason why ancient men and women, that have formerly under the
Prelatical Government been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">{139}</a></span>
admitted to the Sacrament, are required to submit unto
Examination, before they can be again admitted; It
remains, That we give Answers to the Objections that
are brought against this way of Examination; but before
we do this, we will first offer certain Reasons and
Motives (besides those already named) to perswade
every one of our respective Congregations, as well old,
as young, rich as poor, freely and cheerfully to submit
unto it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Motive 1.</div>

<p>The first <i>Motive</i>, is <i>from the evident necessity of it, especially
now, while we are reforming the promiscuous admission of all sorts of
people to the Lords Table, formerly so scandalous</i>.</p>

<p>And this appears; because,</p>

<p>1. Without this, how can <i>ignorant persons</i> (<i>unfit to
communicate</i>) be detected? what other ordinary and regular course
can be imagined, to discover who are insufficient in regard of their
want of knowledge? And it is most certain, that there are many
ignorant persons, old, as well as young, rich, as well as poor, in the
most knowing Congregations; and many times, those whom we suppose <i>to
be very skilful in the word of Righteousnesse</i>, upon <i>Examination</i>
are found to be <i>babes in knowledge</i>.</p>

<p>2. Without this course, multitudes of ignorant persons, both old and
young, will intrude themselves, who by reason of their ignorance,
being not able to discern the Lords body, must needs <i>eat and drink
Judgment to themselves, and become guilty of the body and blood of
Christ</i>, 1&nbsp;Cor. 11.27, 29.</p>

<p>3. Without this, how shall Ministers and Elders ever come truly to
know the <i>spiritual state</i> of their Congregation, that they may watch
over them in the Lord?</p>

<p>4. Unless every one of the Congregation give an account
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">{140}</a></span>
of their Faith to the Eldership, as well as any one,
the people will be extreamly apt to object unto the <i>Minister
and Elders</i>, partial-dealing in this particular, which
is contrary to that heavy charge of the Apostle, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_196" id="Ref_196" href="#Foot_196">[196]</a></span><i>I charge
thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Elect
Angels, that thou observe these things, without preferring
one before another, doing nothing by partiality.</i> And it will
breed <i>discontents</i> and <i>animosities</i> in the people against the
Eldership, and great <i>divisions</i> and <i>dissentions</i> among
themselves.</p>

<p>5. This course should be submitted to by the most intelligent and
knowing Christians in a Congregation, that by their <i>good
example</i>, and <i>professed subjection</i> to the Government of Christ,
those that have not so great a measure of knowledge, and so have more
need to come, may more readily and effectually be perswaded to do the
same.</p>

<p>6. Finally, how can the <i>Ministers and Elders</i>, intrusted by God with
the <i>Oversight of their flock</i>, keep themselves pure from the sin of
those Persons, who through ignorance cannot chuse but prophane the
Lords Supper; unless by this means, they use their best endeavors to
finde out where ignorance is, and to remove it: And it is their duty
to <i>keep themselves pure</i>, <i>and not to be partakers of other mens
sins</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Motive 2.</div>

<p>The second motive, is from the <i>great profit and benefit that will
redound to our respective Congregations, from this practice, prudently
and faithfully undertaken, and universally submitted unto</i>. For,</p>

<p>1. Hereby the whole Congregation, in all the members of it, shall
receive much advantage and edification, whilest those that are
<i>knowing</i>, shall be encouraged, and those that are <i>weaker</i> in
understanding, further strengthened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">{141}</a></span>
in knowledg; and those that are <i>ignorant</i>, put into
a way of gaining knowledge, and so be prepared to partake
of the Ordinance of the Lords Supper, more conscionably;
and more comfortably discern the Lords
body, which is done by <i>knowledge</i>; as well as by <i>Faith</i>,
1&nbsp;<i>Cor.</i> 11.29.</p>

<p>2. Hereby the great offence of promiscuous, or mixt communion, will be
prevented, which hath been heretofore, and is to this day, a great
grief to the godly, both Ministers and people: and which hath been,
and is daily objected against us, by them that separate from our
Churches, as the ground why they are necessitated to depart from us;
and are still discouraged from returning to us.</p>

<p>3. Hereby a <i>good foundation</i> will be laid, of carrying on that
<i>reall reformation</i> which we have <i>covenanted for</i>, both in
Congregations, families, and particular persons; <i>growth in knowledge</i>
being a great means to further <i>our growth in the grace of our Lord
Jesus Christ</i>, 2&nbsp;Pet. 3.18.</p>

<p>4. Hereby those uncomfortable and disorderly fractions
and divisions among the members of our severall
Congregations, (some refusing to submit to all orders,
while others christianly submit themselves,) wil in good
measure be <i>cured</i>, and our Congregations to the <i>glory of
God</i>, and the comfort of <i>Minister</i>, <i>and Elders</i>, be reduced
to a sweet Harmonious <i>unity and uniformity</i>, not only in
judgment, but in practice, both thinking and doing the
same thing; which were a <i>Gospel-blessing</i> much to be desired,
as a fruit of that Ancient Promise, <i>Jer.</i> 32.39.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Motive 3.</div>

<p>The third Motive is from the <i>Mischiefs that will inevitably ensue
upon the neglect of this practice</i>. For hereby,</p>

<p>1. <i>Ignorant persons</i> shall go on in their ignorance undiscovered,
unreformed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">{142}</a></span>
2. The <i>Lords Supper</i> in many Congregations will be wholly disused,
or miserably prophaned. 3. Particular Congregations will be filled with
distractions and discontents, whilest a great part among them refuse to
walk orderly. 4. The <i>Ministers and Elders</i>, who sincerely tender the
spiritual welfare of their Congregations will be much <i>discouraged</i>
and <i>discomforted</i>.</p>

<p>5. The <i>Work of Reformation</i>, and particularly the growth of people
in knowledg and the grace of Jesus Christ, will extreamly be obstructed
and hindered; <i>and whosoever shall be any cause or occasion thereof,
will but uncomfortably answer it unto Jesus Christ</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Motive 4.</div>

<p>The fourth Motive, is from the <i>weaknesse and insuffiency</i> of the
objections that are brought against this practice; To which we shall
now (God assisting us) return <i>distinct</i>, and we hope,
<i>satisfactory</i> Answers.</p>

<p>The Objections are:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Object.</i> 1.</div>

<p>Many who are well inclined, object their own <i>timorousness</i>: And
have <i>jealousies</i> that the Minister will propound such hard and
unusual questions, as they shall not on a sudden be able to answer.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i> 1.</div>

<p>The Questions to be propounded by the Eldership to persons, before
they come to the Lords Table, are for the substance of them contained
in the <i>Ordinance of Parliament</i>, of the 20<sup>th</sup> of <i>October</i>,
1643. the particulars thereof being the <i>fundamentalls of Religion</i>,
contained usually in most <i>Catechismes</i>, which persons of the meanest
capacity ought to understand.</p>

<p>2. We doubt not but the <i>Ministers with the Elders</i>, will make it
their serious Endeavours, to deal with all persons in all <i>Prudence,
meeknesse, tendernesse, and love</i>, as the condition of those that come
before them shall require; They being not insensible of their own
<i>weaknesse</i>, will take heed of Discouraging the meanest, or Quenching
the smoaking flax, well knowing, <i>That they are not to Lord it over
Gods heritage, but to promote their growth, and to be Helpers of their
joy</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote4"><i>Object.</i> 2.</div>

<p>Why may not people be now admitted to the Sacrament, without
examination, as well as before the Elders were chosen?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i> 2.</div>

<p>Because; 1. Before Elders were chosen, and the foundation of
Church-Government begun to be laid, the Church of <i>England</i> was in
<i>point of Church Government</i> in an unreformed condition: But now
(blessed be God) in a way of Reformation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">{143}</a></span>
And we have in our <i>Nationall Covenant</i>, <i>sworn to endeavour
a reformation in Church-Government, according to the
Word of God</i>. In pursuance of that Covenant, there are
many Ordinances of Parliament, to require it; and accordingly
it is practised in many Congregations; and
<i>shall we still persist in our old unreformed way?</i></p>

<p>2. The <i>Promiscuous admission</i> of all sorts of Persons heretofore
without examination tended much to the <i>Prophanation of the Lords
Supper</i>, and was a great <i>scandall</i> in our Church, <i>Hazarded</i>
the souls of thousands, <i>occasioned</i> separations from our Churches,
brought the judgments of God upon the <i>Kingdome</i>, and was no small
griefe to godly Ministers, &amp;c. But now God having provided a further
Remedy, we ought not only, not to <i>oppose it</i>, but to <i>submit</i> to it,
with all readiness and thankfulness.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Object.</i> 3.</div>

<p>Will you have the <i>Ancient men of a Congregation, that have
for divers years been partakers of the Sacrament, come now in
their Old Age to be Examined; will you have Noblemen, and
Rich men, and Aldermen</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i> 1.</div>

<p>We have formerly declared, That the Presbyteriall Government doth not
precisely require of those that come to the Sacrament, <i>That they
should first be Examined by Questions and Answers: But if any man
shall make a good profession of his Faith, in a continued discourse,
without being asked any Questions, it will be accepted, as well as if
they were Examined by particular Questions.</i></p>

<p>2. We have likewise shewed the Reason why Ancient men and women, that
have formerly been admitted, are required to submit to Examination,
before they can be again admitted, &amp;c. We have intreated you, to
distinguish between a <i>Church-reforming in Discipline, and
reformed</i>: When a Church is once reformed, and members admitted by
Examination of the Eldership, there will never be any necessity of
coming afterwards to Ministers and Elders, for re-admission; (unless
it be in case of excommunication.) But in a Church reforming, as ours
is, when all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">{144}</a></span>
sorts have formerly been admitted, without any Distinction,
then <i>Old men</i> must be willing to give an account, as well as <i>young
men</i>, and <i>rich men</i>, as well as <i>poor</i>: Because,</p>

<p>1. Old men and rich men are found to be <i>ignorant</i>, and to prophane
the Sacrament, as well as <i>young men</i>, and <i>poor men</i>.</p>

<p>2. In Gospell-administrations God is no respecter of persons; neither
must his Officers be, if they would be found faithfull in their
places; <i>It is not gray hairs, nor silken coats; but knowledg, faith,
repentance, love and thankefulness, will qualifie a man for the
Sacrament.</i></p>

<p>3. If old men and rich men are more gracious and knowing, then others,
their good examples will be mighty incouragements, to draw on the
younger, and poorer sort. And wherein can <i>Noblemen, and Richmen,
express their thankfulness to God, for his distinguishing mercies
towards them, better, then in becoming patterns and presidents to
others, in their ready obedience to the will of Christ</i>, in this
particular?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Object.</i> 4.</div>

<p>We are willing to come to the <i>Minister alone</i>, to be examined; But
we will never come before the <i>Ruling-Elders</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i> 1.</div>

<p>The Office of the <i>Ruling Elders</i>, as they are distinct from
<i>teaching Elders</i>, is grounded upon Scripture; and is not an
invention of man, but an <i>Ordinance of Christ</i>, (as we have shewed,)
and therefore to be submitted unto.</p>

<p>2. Admission of members to the Sacrament, is an act of Church-Government,
and therefore belongs to the Elders, as well as the Minister: (as we
have likewise shewed.) <i>Church-Government is not committed by Christ
unto Ministers severally, but, to Ministers and Elders joyntly</i>,
Matth. 10.17. 1&nbsp;Cor. 12.28. 1&nbsp;Tim. 5.17. 1&nbsp;Thess. 5.12. Act. 15.6.
Act. 20.17, 28. And therefore in conscience, people ought to submit to
the Ministers and Elders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">{145}</a></span>
3. This is a Practice according to the example of the <i>best reformed
Churches</i>, wherein Elders are joyned with Ministers in this
particular.</p>

<p>4. To devolve this work upon one Minister alone, as
it is sinful, so it will prove very <i>prejudicial</i>, both to Minister
and People: For in some places <i>Ministers</i> may
not be so faithful and Prudentiall as they ought to be,
and may, through pride, covetousness, partiality, or rashness,
keep from the Sacrament, or admit to the Sacrament,
whom Christ would not have admitted, or kept away.
And in other places, where <i>Ministers</i> are more <i>wise</i>, and
<i>humble</i>, and <i>faithfull</i>, if they should assume the power
of Examination, without <i>Elders</i> assisting of them, they
will be wofully <i>mis-reported</i> and scandalized by those
that come before them, or by others, that are disaffected
to them; For if such horrid and base reports are already
raised about the Questions propounded by the Minister
and Elders, when they sit together; (as by sad experience
these wicked dayes of ours will witnesse:) what
will not ungodly men be afraid to report, when the Minister
alone shall ingross this power?</p>

<p>5. We have formerly shewed, that these Elders whom you so much oppose,
are such <i>as you either have, or might have chosen; and they were
chosen for the relief and benefit or the Congregation, that so the
Minister might not be sole judge of those that come to the Sacrament,
but might have others joyned with him, to see that he doth nothing out
of envy, malice, pride, or partiality; but that all things may be
managed for the good and edification of those for whose sake they are
chosen</i>: And therefore it is a wonder to us, to hear men speak so
much against <i>Ruling-Elders</i>, when they are purposely chosen for their
<i>own relief and benefit</i>.</p>

<p>6. We have also formerly shewed, that when the Parliament
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">{146}</a></span>
gave their allowance to the Presbyterial Government,
if they had put the whole <i>juridical power</i> of
the Church, into the hands of one Minister alone, they
that now seem so willing to come to be examined by
the Minister, without his Elders, would have more bitterly
declaimed against that way, then now they do against
this: For this indeed were to make every Minister
a <i>Prelate</i> in his Congregation; and to bring in that,
which hath some Resemblance to <i>Auricular confession</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Object.</i> 5.</div>

<p>Though some <i>Ministers rigidly keep all from the Sacrament, that
will not come before the Eldership; yet there are others that are
Presbyterians, and have Elders chosen, that examine without them, and
will receive us to the Sacrament, without coming before them.</i></p>

<p>In answer to this,</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></div>

<p>1. We doubt whether there be any <i>Ministers</i> of the Presbyterian
judgment, that do thus practise.</p>

<p>2. If there be any such, we conceive that herein they
act not only contrary to an <i>Ordinance of Parliament</i>, but
to an <i>Ordinance of Christ</i>, who hath given the power of
Discipline, not to <i>one Minister</i>, (as we have said) but to
an <i>united company of Presbyters</i> And for one Minister
to assume this power unto himself, is (as we have also
declared) <i>to make himself the whole Church; It is to build
up what he hath destroyed, and to usurp the Prelaticall power
of sole jurisdiction, in his Congregation.</i> For he doth not
only assume a Pastoral power of instructing those that
are to come to the Sacrament, but an Authoritative
power of admitting to, &amp; keeping from the Sacrament;
which is to take to himself an authority that Christ hath
never given him. And we desire these Ministers to consider
what we have formerly delivered, <i>That it is as warrantable
by the Word of God for one Minister to assume the</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">{147}</a></span>
<i>whole power of suspending persons from the Sacrament, who
have been duly admitted thereunto, as it is to assume the whole
power of admitting to the Sacrament</i>, &amp;c. And further we
beseech and intreat them (if there be any such,) to consider
what an offence they give in this particular, to all
their Brethren in the Ministry; and what an argument
they put into the mouthes of those that are disaffected
to the government; and in the fear of God to forsake
this way and course, lest while they think <i>to build with
us, they be found to be destroyers, both of the Presbyterian
Government and Ministry, and to open a wide door to Sacramental
Prophanation</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Object.</i> 6.</div>

<p>Doth not the Scripture say, <i>Let a man examine himself, and so let
him eat?</i> &amp;c. but it no where saith, Let a man be examined by the
Minister and Elders.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></div>

<p>1. The text speaks of those that were formerly admited
in a due way to the Sacrament; and of such it is only
required, that they should <i>examine themselves</i>: For the
Examining of those amongst us that have formerly bin
admitted, is occasioned by the great Church deformation
that hath been amongst us; which being once
healed, there will not be again that need afterwards of
<i>Church-Examination.</i></p>

<p>2. The Apostles words are not to be understood <i>restrictively and
exclusively</i>. For he doth not say, Let a man examine himself <i>only</i>,
But let a man <i>Examine himself</i>, that is, Let him <i>especially
examine himself</i>. Take a parallel text, Rom. 14.12. <i>So then every
one of us shall give an account of himself to God</i>; which text is
not to be understood exclusively; For it is certain, that Ministers
must give an account to God, not only of themselves, but also for
their people; And Parents and Masters, for their children, and
servants; so it is here, Let a man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">{148}</a></span>
examine himself: This doth not exclude the duty of a
father, in examining his children; or of a Master, Minister,
or Elder, in examining those under his Charge:
But it teacheth us, That we must not rest in, nor trust to
the Examination of our Father, Master, Minister, or Elders,
but likewise examine our selves: <i>If a childe, or servant
should say unto his father, or master, when he is examined
about his knowledge, or faith, The Scripture bids me examine
my self, and therefore I will not be examined by you.
Would not this be accounted a great affront, and an unnsufferable
abuse to the holy Scriptures?</i> and yet just so do they
reason &amp; argue, that from this Scripture, would exempt
themselves from all examination by Minister &amp; Elders.
And so likewise when Christ saith, Matth, 7.1. <i>Judge
not, that you be not judged</i>: He that should interpret that
text <i>exclusively</i>, of all kind of judging; would overthrow
all Magistracy. But it is to be understood only, as excluding
private and rash judging, (when a man judgeth
his Brother, and hath no calling to judge him, not a just
cause:) so it is here; This text excludes all private Christians
from examining others; but to say, that it excludes
all men in office and place in the Church, and in
the family, would at once destroy all Church-Government,
and all family-government.</p>

<p>3. We might add, that those that are most ready to pretend, that it is
needless to give an account before the Minister and Elders, because
they are to <i>examine themselves</i>, it is to be feared, are as
regardless of examining themselves, as unwilling to give an account to
the Eldership.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Object.</i> 7.</div>

<p>Doth not the Scripture also say, <i>whosoever eateth and drinketh
unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself</i>? It is not
said, to the Eldership.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">{149}</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></div>

<p>That text is not to be understood <i>exclusively</i>, unless it relate to
close hypocrites: An <i>hypocrite</i> eats and drinks damnation to himself
only, but if it relates to those that are <i>grosly ignorant and
scandalous</i>, it cannot be understood exclusively. For when a man
that is grosly ignorant and scandalous, receives the Sacrament, he not
only eats and drinks judgment to himself, but the <i>guilt of the sin
lyeth upon all those that knew of it, and did not do their duty for
the hindering of it</i>, as we have formerly shewed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Object.</i> 8.</div>

<p>There are many <i>Elders</i> that are very ignorant, and fiter rather to
be <i>examined</i>, then to <i>examine</i>; and that propound unbeseeming
and absurd questions.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></div>

<p>The ignorance of some Elders doth no more prejudice the office of an
Elder, then the ignorance of some Physitians, or Ministers, doth the
calling of Ministers and Physitians: If ignorant Elders be chosen, the
fault is not in the Office, but in the Choosers.</p>

<p>2. This objection cannot be justly made against the Ruling-Elders
within this Province; we hope we may say without boasting, that they
are very knowing, and very godly; and we are confident, that all the
reports that are vented concerning absurd and unbeseeming questions,
&amp;c. are meer lyes and falsities. In all such meetings, the Minister is
the Moderator, and he onely propounds the questions; the Elders sit by
and judge.</p>

<p>3. In those Parishes where there are none sufficiently qualified to be
Elders, the Presbyterian Government doth not require them to chuse
Elders, but Orders, <i>That all such Parishes should be under the
immediate care, inspection, and government of the Classical
Presbytery</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Object.</i> 9.</div>

<p>It is not enough for a <i>Minister to forewarn his people of the
danger of unworthy coming to the Lords Supper; and if they will
notwithstanding the warning, come unworthily, is not the Minister
free?</i></p>

<p>It is not enough for a father to tell his child, that he must not
drink such a cup of poyson, and yet afterwards (when he seeth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">{150}</a></span>
his child very greedy of it) to give it him; especially, when
he knoweth that it will certainly poyson him. It was not enough
for old <i>Eli</i> to admonish his Sons; but because he did not
use his power, in hindring them, he is reproved, as accessary to
their sins.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Object.</i> 10.</div>

<p>I have <i>lived thus long, and never yet was examined, and certainly I
will not now begin in my old age, I will rather never receive the
Sacrament at all</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></div>

<p>Old Customes are no good principles to build upon; these are times of
Reformation.</p>

<p>2. Consider thine own spiritual wants, and what need thou hast of this
blessed Ordinance; and remember what the servant of <i>Naaman</i> said
unto him, <i>If the Prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest
thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith, Wash and
be clean?</i> So give Us leave to say to you, <i>If Christ had
commanded you to do some great thing, would you not have done it,
rather then be deprived of this Ordinance? how much rather when he
saith to thee only, Come and give an account of thy Faith before the
Eldership, and thou shalt be made partaker of this Heavenly
banquet?</i></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Object.</i> 11.</div>

<p>But I have made a Vow, that I will never come before the Elders.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></div>

<p>This Vow is rash and sinful, a bond of iniquity; and therefore by
keeping of it, you become guilty of a double sin: the Eldership is an
Ordinance of Christ (as we have shewed) and therefore not to be vowed
against.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Object.</i> 12.</div>

<p>I am every way able to examine my self, and none knows what is in my
heart; and therefore I will venture upon my own private examination.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Answ.</i></div>

<p>How is it, that thou art unwilling to venture thy estate, without
first advising with a Lawyer: and wilt advise with Physitians about
thy bodily health; but wilt venture thy soul at the Sacrament, upon
thine own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">{151}</a></span>
head, without taking the advice of Minister and Elders;
<i>Is thy soul less precious to thee, then thy body, or thy estate?</i>
Besides, if thou hast knowledg, why wilt thou not come
to examination; if no knowledg, why wilt thou refuse
the way &amp; means to get knowledg? the truth is, the true
ground why some men do oppose this way, is either,</p>

<p>1. Out of ignorance and pride, because they are impatient to have
their ignorance discovered:</p>

<p>2. Or else, Secondly, it is from a prophane spirit of opposition; not
onely against Church-Government, and all good order; but against all
the wayes of Christ. But let such persons consider;</p>

<p>1. That it is far better to have their ignorance cured, then covered:
Ignorance covered will make us go blindfold to Hell; But Ignorance
cured, will make us go with open eyes to Heaven.</p>

<p>2. That Christ accounts them his enemies, that will not have him to
<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_197" id="Ref_197" href="#Foot_197">[197]</a></span><i>reign
over them</i>, and will destroy them as his enemies.</p>

<p>3. To hate Instruction and Reformation, is a certain sign of
wickedness, which God abhors.</p>

<p>4. All the opposition that carnal and rebellious spirits have against
Christ and his wayes, will in the end, prove kicking against the
pricks, and most pernicious to their own Souls.</p>

<p>And thus we have answered all those objections, that are usually
brought against this way of Examination, and herein (as we hope) have
given abundant satisfaction to all those that are willing to receive
it. And we have likewise finished our Exhortation. As for the successe
of it, we leave it wholy to God; as having learn't, that <i>duty is
ours</i>, but <i>success is Gods</i>. When <i>Paul</i> had finished
his Sermon at <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_198" id="Ref_198" href="#Foot_198">[198]</a></span><i>Athens,
some mocked; and others said,</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">{152}</a></span>
<i>we will hear thee again of this matter. Howbeit certain men
clave unto him, and believed, &amp;c.</i> We doubt not but
there are many within the Province; whose hearts <i>the
Lord will open, to attend to what is here said</i>. Our desire is
to do good unto all, even unto those that are our greatest
adversaries; and not <i>to be overcome of evil, but to overcome
evil with good</i>. If they mock at us (as they did at
<i>Paul</i>) yet surely, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_199" id="Ref_199" href="#Foot_199">[199]</a></span><i>Our
Judgment is with the Lord, and our
work with our God; He that is filthy, let him be filthy still;
and he that is unjust, let him be unjust still</i>: But we hope
better things of you, that have submitted to the Presbyterian-Government.
For whom we pray, <span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_200" id="Ref_200" href="#Foot_200">[200]</a></span><i>That the
God of peace, that brought again from the dead our</i> Lord Jesus
Christ, <i>that great Shepherd of his sheep, through the
bloud of the everlasting</i> Covenant, <i>would make you perfect

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
